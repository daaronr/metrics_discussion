### Interpretation of CI's (aside)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The fact that 95% of all (correct) CIs contain the true value does not mean that 95% of those that exclude zero do so correctly. You could have (say) 59% correct coverage for 10% excluding zero and 99% for 90% including zero.</p>&mdash; Stephen John Senn (@stephensenn) <a href="https://twitter.com/stephensenn/status/1219680319114227714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Causal vs. descriptive; 'treatment effects' and the potential outcomes causal model

### DAGs and Potential outcomes
