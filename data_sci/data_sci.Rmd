Some guidelines from a particular project:

[Appendix: Tech for creating, editing and collaborating on this â€˜Bookdownâ€™ web book/project (and starting your own)](https://daaronr.github.io/ea_giving_barriers/bookdown-appendix.html)

### Managing references/citations


```{block2,  type='note'}
A letter to my co-authors...

Hi all.

Hope you are doing well. I've just invited you to a shared Zotero group managing my bibliography/references. I think this should be useful. (I prefer Zotero to Mendeley because it's open source and... I forgot the other reason.)
On my computer it synchronizes with a .bib (bibtex) file in a dropbox folder ...

For latex files we just refer to this as normal.
In the Rmd files/bookdown (producing output like [EA barriers](#https://daaronr.github.io/ea_giving_barriers/outline.html) or Metrics notes (present book) this is referenced in the YAML header to the index.Rmd file as

> bibliography: [reinstein_bibtex.bib]

Then, to keep this file, I have a "download block" included in that same file (the first line with 'dropbox' is the key one).

```

\

The download code follows (remove the 'eval=FALSE' to get it to actually run)...

```{r download-formatting-to-support-folder-example, eval=FALSE}

tryCatch( #trycatch lets us 'try' to execute and if there is an error, it does the thing *after* the braces, rather than crashing
  {
   download.file(url = "https://www.dropbox.com/s/3i8bjrgo8u08v5w/reinstein_bibtex.bib?raw=1", des tfile = "reinstein_bibtex.bib") #download the bibtex database

        download.file(url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daaronr/dr-rstuff/master/bookdown_template/support/tufte_plus.css", destfile = here("support", "tufte_plus.css")) #this downloads the style file

  }, error = function(e) {
    print("you are not online, so we can't download")
  }
)
```

### An example of dynamic code


Shapiro Wilk test for normality; professor salaries at some US university from the built in Cars data...

<div class="marginnote">
By the way, if anyone wants me to offer me a job at that university, it looks like a great deal!
</div>

```{r Diagnostic-tests, include=TRUE}


prof_sal_shapiro_test <- shapiro.test(carData::Salaries$salary)

  # ShapiroTest <- map_df(list(SXDonShapiroTest, EXDonShapiroTest), tidy)
  # (ShapiroTest <- kable(ShapiroTest) %>% kable_styling())
```

The results from the Shapiro Wilk normality test ...

The p-values are  `r prof_sal_shapiro_test[2]` suggesting this data `r ifelse(prof_sal_shapiro_test[2]<0.10, "is not", "is")` normal

## Good coding practices

### New tools and approaches to data (esp 'tidyverse')

From [Kurtz](https://bookdown.org/content/3890/small-worlds-and-large-worlds.html):

> If you are new to tidyverse-style syntax, possibly the oddest component is the pipe (i.e., `%>%`). I'm not going to explain the `%>%` in this project, but you might learn more about in [this brief clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yjhxvu-pDg), starting around [minute 21:25 in this talk by Wickham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-ss_ag2k9E&t=1285s), or in [section 5.6.1 from Grolemund and Wickham's *R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#combining-multiple-operations-with-the-pipe). Really, all of Chapter 5 of *R4DS* is just great for new R and new tidyverse users. And *R4DS* Chapter 3 is a nice introduction to plotting with ggplot2.

### Style and consistency

#### lower_snake_case {-}

Use `lower_snake_case` to name *all* objects (that's my preference anyways)
unless there's a strong reason to do otherwise.

\

This includes:

`file_names.txt`
`folder_names`
`function_names` (with few exceptions)
`names_of_data_objects_like_vectors`
`names_of_data_output_objects_like_correlation_coefficients`
`ex_df1` In R you probably should keep data frame names short to avoid excessive typing

\

*And by all that is holy, never put spaces or slashes in file or object names!* This can make it very hard to process across systems... there are various ways of referring to spaces and other white space.

#### Indenting and spacing


### Using functions, variable lists, etc., for clean, concise, readable code

### Mapping over lists to produce results



<!-- ft <- list(ft_treat_no_ask, ft_treat_no_ask_19, ft_treat_no_ask_19_short, ft_treat_no_ask_19_long)

ft_names <- c("All", "2019", "2019-short", "2019-long")

ft <- map2(ft, ft_names, function(x, y) {
  broom::tidy(x) %>% add_column(Experiment = y)
}) %>%
  bind_rows() %>%
  kable(, caption = "S2 Donation incidence by S1 Ask/no-ask; Fisher tests", digits = 2) %>%
  kable_styling()
-->

### Building results based on 'lists of filters' of the data set

In writing a paper you very often want to produce 'statistics A-F for subsets S1-S5'.

Can't we just automate this?

\


We can store a filter as a character vector and then apply it
```{r}

selection_statement <- "Species == 'setosa' & Petal.Width>0.3"

iris %>%
   as.tibble() %>%
    filter(rlang::eval_tidy(rlang::parse_expr(selection_statement)))
```

Making this a function for later use:

```{r}

selection_statement <- "Species == 'setosa' & Petal.Width>0.3"


filter_parse =  function(df, x) {
  {{df}} %>%
   filter(rlang::eval_tidy(rlang::parse_expr({{x}})))
}

iris %>%
  as.tibble() %>%
 filter_parse(selection_statement)

```



We can do the same for a list of character vectors of filter statements, and apply each filter from the list to the dataframe, and then the output function:

```{r}

sel_st <- c("Species == 'setosa' & Petal.Width>0.3", "Species == 'virginica' & Petal.Width>2.4")

map(iris, selection_statement)

sel_st %>% map(~ filter_parse(iris, .x))

```

It works nicely if you have a list of filters aligned with a list of names or other objects 'specific to each filter'


(Code below: adapt to public data and explain)

```
 bal_sx <-
    map2(subsets_sx_dur, subsets_sx_dur_name, function(x, y) {
      filter_parse(sa, x) %>%
    dplyr::filter(stage == "2") %>%
     tabyl(treat_1, treat_2, show_missing_levels = FALSE)  %>%
    adornme_not(cap = paste(y, "; 1st and 2nd stage treatments"))
    }
  )
```


### Coding style and indenting in Stata (one approach)

I indent every line except

- clear, import, save, merge ('file operations')
  - except where these occur as part of a loop, in which case I put in an 'important comment' noting these operations

- lines that call other do files

- important comments/flags/to-do's


I only put 'small todo' elements having to do with code in a code file itself (and even then there may be better places). If we are going to put todos I suggest we include `#todo` to search for these later (and R has a utility to collect these in a nice way... maybe Stata does too.


\


Whenever there are more than 20 lines of something prosaic that cannot/has not been put into a loop or function, I suggest we put it in a separate 'do' file and call that do file (with no indent).  That's what I do here, giving a brief description and a 'back link'.  Sometimes I put all those do files into an separate folder.
