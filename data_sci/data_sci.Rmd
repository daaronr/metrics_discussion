# Getting, cleaning and using data {#data-sci}

This will build on my content [here](https://daaronr.github.io/writing_econ_research/economic-theory-modeling-and-empirical-work.html#getting-and-using-data), and integrate with it.

## Data: What/why/where/how

## Organizing a project

## Dynamic documents (esp Rmd/bookdown)

### Managing references/citations


```{block2,  type='note'}
A letter to my co-authors...

Hi all.

Hope you are doing well. I've just invited you to a shared Zotero group managing my bibliography/references. I think this should be useful. (I prefer Zotero to Mendeley because it's open source and... I forgot the other reason.)
On my computer it synchronizes with a .bib (bibtex) file in a dropbox folder ...

For latex files we just refer to this as normal. 
In the Rmd files/bookdown (producing output like [EA barriers](#https://daaronr.github.io/ea_giving_barriers/outline.html) or Metrics notes (present book) this is referenced in the YAML header to the index.Rmd file as

> bibliography: [reinstein_bibtex.bib]

Then, to keep this file, I have a "download block" included in that same file (the first line with 'dropbox' is the key one).

```  

\

The download code follows (remove the 'eval=FALSE' to get it to actually run)...

```{r download-formatting-to-support-folder-example, eval=FALSE}

tryCatch( #trycatch lets us 'try' to execute and if there is an error, it does the thing *after* the braces, rather than crashing
  {
    download.file(url = "https://www.dropbox.com/s/24ndb3p9aa0tfv2/reinstein_references.bib?raw=1", destfile = "reinstein_references.bib") #download the bibtex database
    download.file(url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daaronr/dr-rstuff/master/bookdown_template/support/tufte_plus.css", destfile = here("support", "tufte_plus.css")) #this downloads the style file
    
  }, error = function(e) {
    print("you are not online, so we can't download")
  }
)
```


## Good coding practices


### New tools and approaches to data (esp 'tidyverse')

### Style and consistency

Indenting, snake-case, etc

### Using functions, variable lists, etc., for clean, concise, readable code
