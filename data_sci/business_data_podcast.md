### Outline

Because of an ancient curse, we live in "interesting times".  Our lives and our businesses have been shaken up. We are dealing with:

1. A dramatically different business, consumer, and working environment in the medium run:

-  E.g., working-from-home, certain channels shut down (retail stores), others expanded (online shopping, online learning...)

2. Potential long-term changes to the structure of the economy and our way of life in general,

- E.g., move to online, remote work, more digital communications, less travel, fear of close contact, departure from cities, isolation of old?

3. A likely recession, but one that does not resemble previous recessions ...
"Artificial", larger but affects sectors differently, recovery may be quicker but more uneven

These each may have different implications for the question "how much should businesses be investing in data?" We don't know what the answer is, on net, but we have some ideas, and we want to get your impressions.

> Under Covid-19, both shoppers and retailers have been forced to adapt, which has accelerated the trend towards online shopping even among those who had previously preferred to go into shop. There will be winners and losers from this forced accelerated digital transformation. How will data and AI give that extra competitive edge for those who wish to succeed?


"Does this justify additional investments in data and AI, and if so, in what ways?" ...


### Talking points and questions

#### Remind ourselves and audience of the key ways firms use data to make decisions

Customers:
Price discrimination and bundling

Tailoring incentives and pricing to avoid 'customer churn'; offers to new customers
- Informed by customer lifetime value - acquisition decision and value of customer... how much to invest towards retention
- Informed by propensity to purchase

Where to target emails/appeals?... (who is the warm list)

Structuring communications and web sites... how much time do they spend on each part of the web site. Behavioral choice architecture... e.g., when do people abandon baskets

- Informed by deep links, cookies, web tracking, experience data, surveys/ratings

Tailoring campaigns and products: A/B testing and that other kind of test (term?)

"Supply side and more"
- Cost and supply chains
- Informed by internal data on production processes
- Input price data (?)

- "Where to locate" decision... where to put new stores (now it's 'which ones to close down')
informed by customer data, market forecasts, competitor data

Predicting demand -->  inventory problem

Service providers get automatic data (e.g., computer server performance indicators)

#### Need data to handle the current (medium-term) crisis environment?


From an experienced executive type

> Businesses don't know how to function. Incredibly chaotic data from their supply chain and retail channel, incredibly hard to plan. [Can existing data help the blind company see?]

> We are in or coming out of the 'holy shit everything is broken' ... now the world needs to operate in a new way for an extended period of time ...

> Most of your business goes online-- an opportunity and necessity to use data

and the recession...

> Doing more with less... need to cut costs. But which costs? How can data inform this decision? Will automation through data/AI/ML be cost-saving?

**Need data to emerge triumphantly in the new post-crisis world?**

> In the crisis winners and losers separate

There are studies (e.g., Srinivasan et al, 2012 suggesting investments in R&D in recessions especially predict future success, and firms underspend, at least in some sectors.  (But is the relationship causal?)

> Now is the time to take the initiative??

> Old models and old assumptions don't keep up... the companies that can do well are the adaptive ones that test and use the data The old ways of learning was too slow.

> Furthermore, you can't do focus groups and interactions as well in the new world; less personal f2f feedback ... [so you may need to rely on automated 'big data']

"UX"

#### Is now the time to tackle 'data silos' and messy data?

> Getting your data shit together -- it's never a good time to do it ... it is not 'sexy' so companies ignore it...  is it sexy now?

Companies may have many 'data silos' (SAP, mysql, xxcloud, salesforce)... none of which talked to each other, no way to bring them together to say 'what do we know about XX customer'
... e.g., one used by product testers, another about purchases or from sales teams, another about service provision/repairs, others from delivery

> there's all sorts of ways our company generates data ... what do they do on the website, clicks etc, how are they using the product (sometimes send info back to the seller), sales data (sales force)... messy data entered into CRMs like salesforce.com. We put a quote together ... some order system, transaction booked, order fulfilled, calls to customer support ... databases for each. And then some clients are not independent observations ... they are parts of the same large company

Followup: Which links will yield the highest value? E.g., should sales forces know which clients are most costly for support teams?


\

**What are the barriers to this?**

**Tech barriers:** Messy data, lack of linking keys, different systems store data formats differently, limited documentation (codebooks etc)

**Legal barriers:** Data protection, what else?

**Political barriers:** Divisions may not want to give up their source of power, sense of fairness ('we collected this data, it's ours')


#### Re-skilling within firms and outside of firms

1. Companies that cannot do as much 'in person' may find that boosting data and tech skills yields a lot of value

2. People with temporarily lower earning potential might use this time as an opportunity to re-skill

3. To the extent that it is largely done remotely, data science becomes even more attractive as a career

Also... any people who are out of work or fear of being put out of work by this may be very interested in retraining for a job that they can work out from home/remotely. There may be a lot of demand for general training to become a data scientist.


### Other notes
Based on Henrik: people are likely to want to keep a close eye on metrics in the future, now is the time to get get your process under control as well as build human capital.

Profusion does lots of BI work --- building dashboards... sysends quickview etc

Data Engineering also plays into Profusion hands

'Data maturity' ... look up articles on this. Descriptive, prescriptive, xxx analytics

RR had many 'data silos' (SAP, mysql, xxcloud, salesforce)... none of which talked to each other, no way to bring them together to say 'what do we know about XX customer'
... e.g., one used by dealers (test drives, events), another about purchases, another services

Profusion public facing case studies you are allowed to speak about.
Podcast brainstorming
... think of additional podcast topics
Categories of podcast/audiences
Priority: specific business questions and things appealing to business audience
Secondary: interesting from a scientific perspective

## Topics proposed

[1. Covid --> invest in data science?]
(link): Should retailers invest more in data science during the current crisis? in Wiki

How does online affect the need for data science etc.

Other rough topic ideas
Extracting value versus adding value with personalisation and segmentation
Scoping and sharing intel chats
Scoping chat
independent data scientists
people at teaching programmes
headhunters and recruiters
people in heavy data branches of firms... maybe independent/small business, startups
non-direct competitors

Apologies for slow reply... things are hectic at home while juggling childcare. Many thanks for offering this interesting opportunity to be part of the conversation. I think I’d be able to help out, but I’d like to get a better sense of what angle you had in mind. I assume it’s on something along the lines of marketing analytics I’d be particularly interested in talking about behavioral analytics (https://www.dropbox.com/s/cvz9b8id0ti1egj/AI_meets_BehavioralScience_Draft.pdf?dl=0) if you think that is a good conversation anchor


Scopers perhaps
Lorenz Adams ("Hi David! Yes I would really like to be part of the conversation. Thanks very much for thinking of me.")
