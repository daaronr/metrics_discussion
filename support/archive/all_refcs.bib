We propose a simple method for modeling interactions between the treatment and covariates. The idea is to modify the covariate in a simple way, and then fit a standard model using the modified covariates and no main effects. We show that coupled with an efficiency augmentation procedure, this method produces valid inferences in a variety of settings. It can be useful for personalized medicine: determining from a large set of biomarkers the subset of patients that can potentially benefit from a treatment. We apply the method to both simulated datasets and gene expression studies of cancer. The modified data can be used for other purposes, for example large scale hypothesis testing for determining which of a set of covariates interact with a treatment variable.},

abstract = {Two competing explanations for why consumers have trouble with financial decisions are gaining momentum. One is that people are financially illiterate since they lack understanding of simple economic concepts and cannot carry out computations such as computing compound interest, which could cause them to make suboptimal financial decisions. A second is that impatience or present-bias might explain suboptimal financial decisions. That is, some people persistently choose immediate gratification instead of taking advantage of larger long-term payoffs. We use experimental evidence from Chile to explore how these factors appear related to poor financial decisions. Our results show that our measure of impatience is a strong predictor of wealth and investment in health. Financial literacy is also correlated with wealth though it appears to be a weaker predictor of sensitivity to framing in investment decisions. Policymakers interested in enhancing retirement wellbeing would do well to consider the importance of these factors.},

options represented as gambles with monetary consequences. In Exp
1 with 67 undergraduates (aged 18-26 yrs), 25 gambles were presented
to Ss: In Exp 2, with 47 undergraduates (aged 18-27 yrs), were presented
45 gambles to Ss. Results from the 2 experiments show that the emotional
reaction to a monetary outcome is not a simple function of the utility
of that outcome. Emotional responses also depend on probabilities
and unobtained outcomes. Unexpected outcomes have greater emotional
impact than expected outcomes. Furthermore, any given outcome is
less pleasant if an unobtained outcome is better. The authors propose
an account of emotional experiences associated with outcomes of decisions
called decision affect theory. Decision affect theory incorporates
utilities, expectations, and counterfactual comparisons into hedonic
responses. Finally, the authors show that choices between risky options
can be described as the maximization of expected emotional experiences,
as predicted by decision affect theory. (PsycINFO Database Record

The model also includes decisions by schools as to which students to accept and how much financial aid to offer. Simulating how black educational choices would change were they to face the white admission and aid rules shows that race-based advantages had little effect on earnings. However, removing race-based advantages does affect black educational outcomes. In particular, removing advantages in admissions substantially decreases the number of black students at top-tier schools, while removing advantages in financial aid causes a decrease in the number of blacks who attend college},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research indicates that certain personality traits relate to performance in the medical profession. Yet, personality testing during selection seems ineffective. In this study, we examine the extent to which different medical school selection processes call upon desirable personality characteristics in applicants.: 1019 of all 1055 students who entered the Dutch Bachelor of Medicine at University of Groningen, the Netherlands in 2009, 2010 and 2011 were included in this study. Students were admitted based on either top pre-university grades (n = 139), acceptance in a voluntary multifaceted selection process (n = 286), or lottery weighted for pre-university GPA. Within the lottery group, we distinguished between students who had not participated (n = 284) and students who were initially rejected (n = 310) in the voluntary selection process. Two months after admission, personality was assessed with the NEO-FFI, a measure of the five factor model of personality. We performed ANCOVA modelling with gender as a covariate to examine personality differences between the four groups.: The multifaceted selection group scored higher on extraversion than all other groups(p0.01), higher on conscientiousness than both lottery-admitted groups(p0.01), and lower on neuroticism than the lottery-admitted group that had not participated in the voluntary selection process. The latter group scored lower on conscientiousness than all other groups(p0.05) and lower on agreeableness than the multifaceted selection group and the top pre-university group(p0.01).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Differences between the four admission groups, though statistically significant, were relatively small. Personality scores in the group admitted through the voluntary multifaceted selection process seemed most fit for the medical profession. Personality scores in the lottery-admitted group that had not participated in this process seemed least fit for the medical profession. It seems that in order to select applicants with suitable personalities, an admission process that calls upon desirable personality characteristics is beneficial.},

abstract = { Norwegian registry data are used to investigate the location decisions of a full population cohort of young adults as they complete their education, establish separate households, and form their own families. We find that the labor market opportunities and family ties of both partners affect these location choices. Surprisingly, married men live significantly closer to their own parents than do married women, even if they have children, and this difference cannot be explained by differences in observed characteristics. The principal source of excess female distance from parents in this population is the relatively low mobility of men without a college degree, particularly in rural areas. Despite evidence that intergenerational resource flows, such as childcare and eldercare, are particularly important between women and their parents, the family connections of husbands appear to dominate the location decisions of less-educated married couples.

abstract = {We randomize advertising content motivated by the psychology literature on sympathy generation and framing effects in mailings to about 185,000 prospective new donors in India. We find significant impact on the number of donors and amounts donated consistent with sympathy biases such as the "identifiable victim," "in-group" and "reference dependence." A monthly reframing of the ask amount increases donors and amount donated relative to daily reframing. A second experiment targeted to past donors, finds that the effect of sympathy bias on giving is smaller in percentage terms but statistically and economically highly significant in terms of the magnitude of additional dollars raised. Methodologically, the paper complements the work of behavioral scholars by adopting an empirical researchers' lens of measuring relative effect sizes and economic relevance of multiple behavioral theoretical constructs in the sympathy bias and charity domain within one field setting. This can provide guidance to managers on which behavioral theories are most managerially and economically relevant when developing advertising content.},

@article{Abramowicz2004,
abstract = {FutureMAP, a project of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,
was to involve experiments to determine whether information markets
could improve Defense Department decisionmaking. Information markets
are securities markets used to derive information from the prices
of securities whose liquidation values are contingent on future events.
The government intended to use such a market to assess the probabilities
of potential political assassinations, and the indelicacy of this
potential application contributed to a controversy leading to the
cancellation of the program. In this Article, Professor Abramowicz
assesses whether information markets in theory could be useful to
administrative agencies, and it concludes that information markets
could help discipline administrative agency predictions, but only
if a number of technical hurdles such as the danger of manipulation
can be overcome. Because the predictions of well-functioning information
markets are objective, they function as a tool that exhibits many
of the same virtues in predictive tasks that cost- benefit analysis
offers for normative policy evaluation. Both approaches can help
to overcome cognitive errors, thwart interest group manipulation,
and discipline administrative agency decisionmaking. The Article
suggests that the two forms of analysis might be combined to produce
a -predictive cost-benefit analysis.- In such an analysis, an information
market would predict the outcome of a retrospective cost- benefit
analysis, to be conducted some years after the decision whether to
enact a particular policy. As long as the identity of the eventual
decisionmaker cannot be anticipated, predictive cost-benefit analysis
estimates how an average decisionmaker would be expected to evaluate
the policy. Because the predictive cost-benefit analysis assessment
is not dependent on the identity of current agency officials, they
cannot shade the numbers to justify policies that the officials prefer
for idiosyncratic or ideological reasons.},

First, the author looks for crowding out in the opposite direction: increased private funding may cause reduced public funding. Second, the author tests whether one type of funding acts as a signal of charity quality and thus crowds in other funding. The author finds evidence that government grants crowd in private donations. Crowding in is larger for younger charities. This is consistent with signaling, if donors know less about younger charities and the signal value is stronger.

abstract = {European labor markets are characterized by the low geographical mobility of workers. The absence of mobility is a factor behind high unemployment when jobless people prefer to remain in their home region rather than to go prospecting in more dynamic areas. In this paper, we attempt to understand the determinants of mobility by introducing the concept of local social capital. Using data from a European household panel (ECHP), we provide various measures of social capital, which appears to be a strong factor of immobility. It is also a fairly large factor of unemployment when social capital is clearly local, while other types of social capital are found to have a positive effect on employability. We also find evidence of the reciprocal causality, that is, individuals born in another region have accumulated less local social capital. Finally, observing that individuals in the South of Europe appear to accumulate more local social capital, while in Northern Europe they tend to invest in more general types of social capital, we argue that part of the European unemployment puzzle can be better understood thanks to the concept of local social capital.},

The resulting VAM estimates are biased if the available control variables fail to capture all cross-school differences in student ability. This paper introduces a new test for VAM bias that asks whether VAM estimates accurately predict the achievement consequences of random assignment to specific schools. Test results from admissions lotteries in Boston suggest conventional VAM estimates may be misleading. This finding motivates the development of a hierarchical model describing the joint distribution of school value-added, VAM bias, and lottery compliance. We use this model to assess the substantive importance of bias in conventional VAM estimates and to construct hybrid value-added estimates that optimally combine ordinary least squares and instrumental variables estimates of VAM parameters. Simulations calibrated to the Boston data show that, bias notwithstanding, policy decisions based on conventional VAMs are likely to generate substantial achievement gains. Estimates incorporating lotteries are less biased, however, and yield further gains.},

abstract = {A randomized experiment with almost 35 million Pandora listeners enables us to measure the sensi-tivity of consumers to advertising, also known as the demand curve for Pandora ad-supported listening. The experiment randomized listeners into nine treatment groups, each of which received a different level of audio advertising interrupting their music listening, with the highest treatment group receiving more than twice as many ads as the lowest treatment group. By keeping consistent treatment assignment for 21 months, we can see that the long-term effects of a change in " ad load, " or number of ads per hour, take over a year to be fully realized. We estimate a demand curve that is strikingly linear, with the number of hours listened decreasing linearly in the number of ads per hour. We also show the negative impact on the number of days listened and on the probability of listening at all in the final month. Using an experimental design that separately varies the number of commercial interruptions per hour and the number of ads per commercial interruption, we find that neither makes any difference to listeners except for the way they increase the total number of ads per hour. Lastly, we find increased ad load causes a significant increase in the number of paid ad-free subscriptions to Pandora, particularly among older listeners.},

R is now widely used in academic research, education, and industry. It is constantly growing, with new versions of the core software released regularly and more than 5,000 packages available. It is difficult for the documentation to keep pace with the expansion of the software, and this vital book series provides a forum for the publication of books covering many aspects of the development and application of R. The scope of the series is wide, covering three main threads: -- Applications of R to specific disciplines such as biology, epidemiology, genetics, engineering, finance, and the social sciences. -- Using R for the study of topics of statistical methodology, such as linear and mixed modeling, time series, Bayesian methods, and missing data. -- The development of R, including programming, building packages, and graphics. The books will appeal to programmers and developers of R software, as well as applied statisticians and data analysts in many fields. The books will feature detailed worked examples and R code fully integrated into the text, ensuring their usefulness to researchers, practitioners and students.},

The book makes clear that applied microeconometrics is about the estimation of marginal and treatment effects, and that parametric estimation is simply a means to this end. It also clarifies the distinction between causality and statistical association.The book focuses specifically on cross section and panel data methods. Population assumptions are stated separately from sampling assumptions, leading to simple statements as well as to important insights. The unified approach to linear and nonlinear models and to cross section and panel data enables straightforward coverage of more advanced methods. The numerous end-of-chapter problems are an important component of the book. Some problems contain important points not fully described in the text, and others cover new ideas that can be analyzed using tools presented in the current and previous chapters. Several problems require the use of the data sets located at the author's website.},

abstract = {In the United States, charitable contributions can be deducted from taxable income making the price of giving inversely related to the marginal tax rate. The existing literature documents that charitable giving is very responsive to tax subsidies, but often ignores the spillover effects of such policies. On the other hand, a growing body of literature documents that giving to others reduces the stress and strengthens the immune system, which results in better health and longer life expectancy. These findings imply that tax subsidies for charitable giving may have positive spillover effects on health. This paper investigates this hypothesis using data from Center on Philanthropy Panel Study (COPPS), the philanthropy module of the Panel Study Income Dynamics (PSID). Understanding the spillover effects of charitable subsidies on health is quite important given the existing literature that links health status to several important economic outcomes. The results show that charitable subsidies have positive spillover effects on health. In particular, the implied cross-price elasticity of health index with respect to giving is -0.13. These results are robust to potential endogeneity of income and highlight the positive externalities created by tax subsidies for charitable giving.},

Stat. 2 (2008) 176-196] critiqued ordinary least squares regression adjustment of estimated treatment effects in randomized experiments, using Neyman's model for randomization inference. Contrary to conventional wisdom, he argued that adjustment can lead to worsened asymptotic precision, invalid measures of precision, and small-sample bias. This paper shows that in sufficiently large samples, those problems are either minor or easily fixed. OLS adjustment cannot hurt asymptotic precision when a full set of treatment-covariate interactions is included. Asymptotically valid confidence intervals can be constructed with the Huber-White sandwich standard error estimator. Checks on the asymptotic approximations are illustrated with data from Angrist, Lang, and Oreopoulos's [Am. Econ. J.: Appl. Econ. 1:1 (2009) 136-163] evaluation of strategies to improve college students' achievement. The strongest reasons to support Freedman's preference for unadjusted estimates are transparency and the dangers of specification search.

Although this so-called 'power of asking' is well-known among fundraisers, the existing literature does not pay much attention to the role of donation requests in charitable giving. This paper uses a unique survey that includes a question on whether the respondent is asked to give to estimate the causal effects of charitable solicitations on giving behavior. In order to address the endogeneity of the donation requests due to non-random solicitation of charitable donors, I link this survey to IRS data on charitable organizations and propose identifying instruments. After controlling for the endogeneity, I find that donation requests increase the propensity to give by about nineteen percentage points for those who are asked to give. This effect is robust under different specifications and with different sets of instruments, and is much larger than the estimates from univariate models, which assume that charitable solicitations are exogenous. I argue that this result is counterintuitive and discuss some possible explanations.},

120 subjects played a three-person-game in which each player could

conditions how much they were willing to give to one loser or each
of two losers in the case of their winning. The great majority of
subjects were willing to make substantial conditional gifts. The
most common type of gift behavior does not lend itself to a straightforward
interpretation as the result of altruistic utility maximization.

propose face as a key variable that can explain much of the complexity
of social interactions in Asian organizations. We attempted to elaborate
on the concept and dynamics of face in Asia in such a way as to capture
its pervasive, significant but often subtle influences on organizational
behavior. We also examined conditions, functions, and consequences
of face dynamics to generate testable propositions for future research.
We argue that scholars have to go beyond the individualistic assumptions
about human behavior implicit in theories of organizational behavior
in the West to better understand the richness of organizational behavior
in Asia. In Asia, organizational behavior is better predicted by
an individual's external attributes such as face than internal attributes
such as desires, emotions, and cognition.},

If they do, is it because the grants crowd out donors who feel they gave through taxes (classic crowd out), or is it because the grant crowds out the fundraising of the charities who, after getting the grant, reduce efforts of fundraising (fundraising crowd-out)? This is the first paper to separate these two effects. Using a panel of more than 8000 charities, we find that crowding out is significant, at about 75{\%}. We find this crowding out is due primarily to reduced fundraising. Depending on which types of organizations are included in the analysis, crowding out attributable to classic crowd-out ranges from 30{\%} to a slight crowd-in effect, while fundraising crowd-out ranges from 70{\%} to over 100{\%} of all crowd-out. Such a finding could have important consequences for how governments structure grants to non-profits. Our results indicate, for example, that requirements that charities match a fraction of government grants with increases in private donations might be a feasible policy that could reduce the detrimental effects of crowding out. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The core methods in today's econometric toolkit are linear regression for statistical control, instrumental variables methods for the analysis of natural experiments, and differences-in-differences methods that exploit policy changes. In the modern experimentalist paradigm, these techniques address clear causal questions such as: Do smaller classes increase learning? Should wife batterers be arrested? How much does education raise wages? Mostly Harmless Econometrics shows how the basic tools of applied econometrics allow the data to speak. In addition to econometric essentials, Mostly Harmless Econometrics covers important new extensions-regression-discontinuity designs and quantile regression-as well as how to get standard errors right. Joshua Angrist and J{\"{o}}rn-Steffen Pischke explain why fancier econometric techniques are typically unnecessary and even dangerous. The applied econometric methods emphasized in this book are easy to use and relevant for many areas of contemporary social science. An irreverent review of econometric essentials A focus on tools that applied researchers use most Chapters on regression-discontinuity designs, quantile regression, and standard errors Many empirical examples A clear and concise resource with wide applications},

abstract = {Many markets have organizations that influence or try to establish
norms concerning when offers can be made, accepted and rejected.
Examining a dozen previously studied markets suggests that markets
in which transactions are made far in advance are markets in which
it is acceptable for firms to make exploding offers, and unacceptable
for workers to renege on commitments they make, however early. But
this evidence is only suggestive, because the markets differ in many
ways other than norms concerning offers. Laboratory experiments allow
us to isolate the effects of exploding offers and binding acceptances.
In a simple environment, in which uncertainty about applicants' quality
is resolved over time, we find inefficient early contracting when
firms can make exploding offers and applicants' acceptances are binding.
Relaxing either of these two conditions causes matching to take place
later, when more information about applicants' qualities is available,
and consequently results in higher efficiency and fewer blocking
pairs. This suggests that elements of market culture may play an
important role in influencing market performance.},

The factors that affect the level of generosity observed in our experiments are reciprocal motivation, the level of money payoffs, and the level of social distance in the experimental protocol. The relatively greater sensitivity of women to the costs of generous behavior can explain most of the apparent inconsistencies in previously reported findings. (JEL C70, C91, D63, D64)},

The ascendancy of the human capital approach can be viewed as a reaction of economists to this non-economic, though certainly not irrelevant, tradition. In stressing the role played by individual and family optimizing decisions in human capital investments, important aspects of income determination are brought back within the mainstream of economic theory and within the power of its analytical and econometric tools. Human capital is not the only element of choice in the analysis of income distribution . Nevertheless, it appears that the subject of human capital investments lends itself to a more systematic and comprehensive analysis of wage differentials, than each of the other factors. The following is a description of research in the distribution of labor incomes in which human capital theory serves as an organizing principle. It is, in part, a sequel to my 1970 survey and, in part, a report of ongoing research of my own and of others.},

abstract = {Conventional value-added models (VAMs) compare average test scores across schools after regression-adjusting for students' demographic characteristics and previous scores. The resulting VAM estimates are biased if the available control variables fail to capture all cross-school differences in student ability. This paper introduces a new test for VAM bias that asks whether VAM estimates accurately predict the achievement consequences of random assignment to specific schools. Test results from admissions lotteries in Boston suggest conventional VAM estimates may be misleading. This finding motivates the development of a hierarchical model describing the joint distribution of school value-added, VAM bias, and lottery compliance. We use this model to assess the substantive importance of bias in conventional VAM estimates and to construct hybrid value-added estimates that optimally combine ordinary least squares and instrumental variables estimates of VAM parameters. Simulations calibrated to the Boston data show that, bias notwithstanding, policy decisions based on conventional VAMs are likely to generate substantial achievement gains. Estimates incorporating lotteries are less biased, however, and yield further gains.},

abstract = {Abstract: Why do individuals choose different types of post-secondary education, and what are the labor market consequences of those choices? We investigate these questions in the context of Norway's post-secondary education system. Our analysis is based on a generalized Roy model where individuals can choose between multiple fields of study. To overcome the challenge of selection bias, we take advantage of Norway's centralized admission process that covers almost all universities and colleges. This process creates discontinuities which effectively randomize applicants near unpredictable admission cutoffs into different fields of study. From the students' applications, we know their ranking of fields and can therefore construct relevant counterfactuals. Our empirical findings may be summarized with three broad conclusions. First, we find that different fields have widely different payoffs. For example, by choosing engineering instead of teaching, individuals more than double the earnings they receive. By comparison, choosing humanities or nursing instead of teaching has little payoff. Second, when disentangling the causal contribution of field of study and institution, we find that field of study drives the heterogeneity in payoffs to post-secondary education. Third, individuals tend to choose fields in which they have comparative and absolute advantage. In contrast, a choice model with one-factor ability-as-IQ is inconsistent with the pattern of selection we estimate. Our study has important implications for the policy debate over mismatch and market frictions in the supply and demand for post-secondary field of study, and for the literature on how to model and correct for selection bias when there are many unordered alternatives.},

abstract = {The true purpose of bitcoin could be to reboot the internet. Right now the cryptocurrency and its cousins, like ethereum, are the province of wild speculation and vast, sudden accumulations of wealth. But as Steven Johnson writes for the New York Times, the underlying blockchain technology could become the new foundation of a secure, decentralized computer network-one where closed services from Facebook, Google, and Amazon exist in a radically different, more accountable form. Or, if those companies miss the boat, perhaps they won't exist at all.},
annote = {You can think of my Ethereum address as having elements of a bank account, an email address and a Social Security number. For now, it exists only on my computer as an inert string of nonsense, but the second I try to perform any kind of transaction - say, contributing to a crowdfunding campaign or voting in an online referendum - that address is broadcast out to an improvised worldwide network of computers that tries to verify the transaction. The results of that verification are then broadcast to the wider network again, where more machines enter into a kind of competition to perform complex mathematical calculations, the winner of which gets to record that transaction in the single, canonical record of every transaction ever made in the history of Ethereum. Because those transactions are registered in a sequence of -blocks- of data, that record is called the blockchain.
The whole exchange takes no more than a few minutes to complete. From my perspective, the experience barely differs from the usual routines of online life. But on a technical level, something miraculous is happening - something that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. I've managed to complete a secure transaction without any of the traditional institutions that we rely on to establish trust. No intermediary brokered the deal; no social-media network captured the data from my transaction to better target its advertising; no credit bureau tracked the activity to build a portrait of my financial trustworthiness.
the potential power of this would-be revolution is being actively undercut by the crowd it is attracting, a veritable goon squad of charlatans, false prophets and mercenaries.},

I estimate a structural model of the following decisions by individuals: where to submit applications, which school to attend, and what field to study. The model also includes decisions by schools as to which students to accept and how much financial aid to offer. Simulating how black educational choices would change were they to face the white admission and aid rules shows that race-based advantages had little effect on earnings. However, removing race-based advantages does affect black educational outcomes. In particular, removing advantages in admissions substantially decreases the number of black students at top-tier schools, while removing advantages in financial aid causes a decrease in the number of blacks who attend college},

One is that people are financially illiterate since they lack understanding of simple economic concepts and cannot carry out computations such as computing compound interest, which could cause them to make suboptimal financial decisions. A second is that impatience or present-bias might explain suboptimal financial decisions. That is, some people persistently choose immediate gratification instead of taking advantage of larger long-term payoffs. We use experimental evidence from Chile to explore how these factors appear related to poor financial decisions. Our results show that our measure of impatience is a strong predictor of wealth and investment in health. Financial literacy is also correlated with wealth though it appears to be a weaker predictor of sensitivity to framing in investment decisions. Policymakers interested in enhancing retirement wellbeing would do well to consider the importance of these factors.},

This result suggests that the latter treatment, first used by Crumpler and Grossman (J Public Econ 92(5-6):1011-1021, 2008), does not provide a clean test of warm glow motivation. We then propose a new method of detecting warm glow motivation based on the idea that in a random-lottery incentive (RLI) scheme, such as the one we employ, warm glow accumulates and this may lead to satiation, whereas purely altruistic motivation does not. We also provide bounds on the magnitudes of warm glow and pure altruism as motives that drive giving in our experiment.},

significantly increases trust. Competition among trustees decreases
trustworthiness, but trustors do not anticipate this effect. In Experiment

regarding the use of the Heckit and the two-part model. First, many
articles invoke the Heckit to solve a supposed

selection problem associated with masses of zero values in continuous
variables, despite the fact that it has been

shown elsewhere that no such selection problem exists when modeling
observed actual, as opposed to latent

potential, outcomes. Second, many applications incorrectly formulate
the marginal effect tests in the Heckit and

two-part model, thus undermining central conclusions. Finally, many
researchers use a t-test of the inverse Mills

coefficient to choose between the Heckit and two-part models despite
its poor performace; we propose instead an

adapted empirical mean square error test.},

Younger workers who received the flyer were significantly more likely to begin contributing to the plan relative to their peers in the control group. Many workers do not participate in their employers' supplemental retirement savings programs, even though these programs offer substantial tax advantages and immediate returns due to matching contributions. From a survey of new hires we find that many workers choose not to contribute to the plan because they have other financial priorities. However, some non-participants lack the financial literacy to appreciate the benefit. These findings indicate that simple informational interventions can nudge workers to participate in retirement saving plans and enhance individual well-being and retirement income security},

@article{Simpson2008,
abstract = {Abstract:

A persistent puzzle in the social and biological sciences is the existence
of prosocial behavior, actions that benefit others, often at a cost
to oneself. Recent theoretical models and empirical studies of indirect
reciprocity show that actors behave prosocially in order to develop
an altruistic reputation and receive future benefits from third parties.
Accordingly, individuals should stop investing in reputations via
prosocial behavior when a future benefit (via indirect reciprocity)
is unlikely. The conclusion that the absence of reputational incentives
necessarily leads to egoistic behavior contrasts sharply with models
of heterogeneous social preferences. Such models demonstrate the
theoretical plausibility of populations composed of egoists and altruists.
Results of Study One show that actors classified a priori as egoists
respond strategically to reputational incentives, whereas those classified
a priori as altruists are less affected by these incentives. Egoists
act prosocially when reputational incentives are at stake but not
when opportunities for indirect reciprocity are absent, while altruists
tend to act prosocially regardless of whether reputational incentives
are present. These results suggest that altruistic behavior can result
from non-strategic altruism or reputation-building egoism. Study
Two replicates these results and explores indirect reciprocation
of others' prosocial acts. We found that altruists indirectly reciprocate
at higher levels than egoists, and individuals tend to discount others'
prosocial behaviors when they occur in the presence of reputational
incentives. As a result, public prosocial behaviors are indirectly
reciprocated less than private prosocial behaviors. In line with
our argument that altruists pay less attention to reputational incentives,
egoists showed a greater tendency than altruists to discount others'
public prosocial behaviors. The results support the growing focus
on heterogeneity of individuals' social preferences in models of
altruism and indirect reciprocity},

abstract = {This paper considers estimation of truncated and censored regression
models with fixed effects in panel data. Up until now, no estimator
has been shown to be consistent as the cross section dimension increases
with the time dimension fixed. Trimmed least absolute deviations
(LAD) and trimmed least squares estimators are proposed for the case
where the panel is of length two, and it is proven that they are
consistent and asymptotically normal under suitable regularity conditions.
It is not necessary to maintain parametric assumptions on the error
terms to obtain this result. Because three of the four estimators
are defined as minimizers of nondifferentiable functions, traditional
methods cannot be used to establish asymptotic normality. Instead,
the approach of Pakes and Pollard (1989) is used. A small scale Monte
Carlo study demonstrates that these estimators can perform well in
small samples. Despite their nonlinear nature, the estimators are
easy to calculate in practice, as are consistent estimators of their
asymptotic variances. Generalization of the estimators to panels
of arbitrary length is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Numerous studies regress log earnings on schooling and report estimated coefficients as `Mincer rates of return'. A more recent literature uses instrumental variables. This chapter considers the economic interpretation of these analyses and how the availability of repeated cross section and panel data improves the ability of analysts to estimate the rate of return. We consider under what conditions the Mincer model estimates an ex post rate of return. We test and reject the model on six cross sections of U.S. Census data. We present a general nonparametric approach for estimating marginal internal rates of return that takes into account tuition, income taxes and forms of uncertainty. We also contrast estimates based on a single cross-section of data, using the synthetic cohort approach, with estimates based on repeated cross-sections following actual cohorts. Cohort-based models fitted on repeated cross section data provide more reliable estimates of ex post returns. Accounting for uncertainty affects estimates of rates of return. Accounting for sequential revelation of information calls into question the validity of the internal rate of return as a tool for policy analysis. An alternative approach to computing economic rates of return that accounts for sequential revelation of information is proposed and the evidence is summarized. We distinguish ex ante from ex post returns. New panel data methods for estimating the uncertainty and psychic costs facing agents are reviewed. We report recent evidence that demonstrates that there are large psychic costs of schooling. This helps to explain why persons do not attend school even though the financial rewards for doing so are high. We present methods for computing distributions of returns ex ante and ex post. We review the literature on instrumental variable estimation. The link of the estimates to the economics is not strong. The traditional instruments are weak, and this literature has not produced decisive empirical estimates. We exposit new methods that interpret the economic content of different instruments within a unified framework.},

abstract = {We estimate the monetary return to attending a highly selective college
using the College and Beyond (C{\&}B) Survey linked to Detailed Earnings
Records from the Social Security Administration (SSA). This paper
extends earlier work by Dale and Krueger (2002) that examined the
relationship between the college that students attended in 1976 and
the earnings they self-reported reported in 1995 on the C{\&}B follow-up
survey. In this analysis, we use administrative earnings data to
estimate the return to various measures of college selectivity for
a more recent cohort of students: those who entered college in 1989.
We also estimate the return to college selectivity for the 1976 cohort
of students, but over a longer time horizon (from 1983 through 2007)
using administrative data.


We find that the return to college selectivity is sizeable for both
cohorts in regression models that control for variables commonly
observed by researchers, such as student high school GPA and SAT
scores. However, when we adjust for unobserved student ability by
controlling for the average SAT score of the colleges that students
applied to, our estimates of the return to college selectivity fall
substantially and are generally indistinguishable from zero. There
were notable exceptions for certain subgroups. For black and Hispanic
students and for students who come from less-educated families (in
terms of their parents' education), the estimates of the return to
college selectivity remain large, even in models that adjust for
unobserved student characteristics.},

Being ignored, excluded, and/or rejected signals a threat for which reflexive detection in the form of pain and distress is adaptive for survival. Brief ostracism episodes result in sadness and anger and threaten fundamental needs. Individuals then act to fortify or replenish their thwarted need or needs. Behavioral consequences appear to be split into two general categories: attempts to fortify relational needs (belonging, self-esteem, shared understanding, and trust), which lead generally to prosocial thoughts and behaviors, or attempts to fortify efficacy/existence needs of control and recognition that may be dealt with most efficiently through antisocial thoughts and behaviors. Available research on chronic exposure to ostracism appears to deplete coping resources, resulting in depression and helplessness.},

abstract = {We survey 1050 consumers who have just redeemed one or more open loop gift certificates to learn whether they view gift certificate income, cash gifts and non-gift income as substitutes. We find that the majority (83{\%}) of recipients spend the certificates in the same way as cash. The other respondents (17{\%}) bought an item they would not have bought otherwise but adjustments in their shopping pattern do not seem to result from constraints in redeeming the certificates: 80{\%} of all respondents in this group says they have used the certificate to buy an item they really love to have. While inconsistent with standard microeconomic demand theory, this behavior can be explained by narrow bracketing: in spending gift certificates, these consumers consider a limited choice set of nice, personal items. Our data show that females are more likely to narrow bracket gift certificate income and that positive reciprocity towards the giver induces narrow bracketing in case the giver is a household member who suggests to buy a particular item using the certificate. Previous studies have found that both giving in-kind gifts (Waldfogel, 1993) as giving gift cards (Offenberg, 2007) entail a welfare loss of 10-30{\%} when compared to giving cash. We find that the welfare effects of open loop gift certificates among users are limited: the consumption of broad bracketing consumers is unaffected and narrow bracketing consumers seem to value the possibility to separate gift certificate income from other income sources.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. In this paper we investigate the role of social preferences and beliefs for voluntary coopera tion. Numerous public goods experiments have shown that many people contribute more to the public good than pure self-interest can easily explain. An equally important observation, how ever, is that free riding increases in repeatedly played public goods experiments across various parameters and participant pools.1 The facts are clear, but their explanation is not. An obvious candidate for explaining the decline of cooperation was learning the free-rider strategy. However, Andreoni (1988) showed that cooperation resumed after a restart, which is inconsistent with a pure learning argument. In a subsequent paper he interpreted the decline in cooperation "to be due to frustrated attempts at kindness, rather than learning the free-riding},

Overall, participants showed low motivation to engage in the process of choosing a private pension plan, compared to their motivation to engage in other decision tasks. However, economists invested more in the decision process and showed greater satisfaction from their decision regarding their pension plan when they had a more positive perception of pensions. This perception is represented by higher subjective likelihood of receiving pension allowances for a long period, and by a profitable view of the balance between current payments and expected incomes from pension saving.},

We propose a solution to this problem: Use donations from major philanthropists to cover overhead expenses and offer potential donors an overhead-free donation opportunity. A laboratory experiment testing this solution confirms that donations decrease when overhead increases, but only when donors pay for overhead themselves. In a field experiment with 40,000 potential donors, we compared the overhead-free solution with other common uses of initial donations. Consistent with prior research, informing donors that seed money has already been raised increases donations, as does a {\$}1:{\$}1 matching campaign. Our main result, however, clearly shows that informing potential donors that overhead costs are covered by an initial donation significantly increases the donation rate by 80{\%} (or 94{\%}) and total donations by 75{\%} (or 89{\%}) compared with the seed (or matching) approach.},

abstract = {Abstract: Why do individuals choose different types of post-secondary education, and what are the labor market consequences of those choices? We investigate these questions in the context of Norway's post-secondary education system. Our analysis is based on a generalized Roy model where individuals can choose between multiple fields of study. To overcome the challenge of selection bias, we take advantage of Norway's centralized admission process that covers almost all universities and colleges. This process creates discontinuities which effectively randomize applicants near unpredictable admission cutoffs into different fields of study. From the students' applications, we know their ranking of fields and can therefore construct relevant counterfactuals. Our empirical findings may be summarized with three broad conclusions. First, we find that different fields have widely different payoffs. For example, by choosing engineering instead of teaching, individuals more than double the earnings they receive. By comparison, choosing humanities or nursing instead of teaching has little payoff. Second, when disentangling the causal contribution of field of study and institution, we find that field of study drives the heterogeneity in payoffs to post-secondary education. Third, individuals tend to choose fields in which they have comparative and absolute advantage. In contrast, a choice model with one-factor ability-as-IQ is inconsistent with the pattern of selection we estimate. Our study has important implications for the policy debate over mismatch and market frictions in the supply and demand for post-secondary field of study, and for the literature on how to model and correct for selection bias when there are many unordered alternatives.},

abstract = {While impact evaluations can be used to measure the causal effect of a program, there are several potential factors that could challenge their external validity. First, it is possible that the projects that are selected for evaluation respond differently to treatment. If this is the case, the results of these evaluations will poorly predict the performance of future programs. Further, while Hawthorne effects could occur within a study, project implementers could also act differently when their project is being evaluated. In this case, the effect of the program would be confounded with the effect of the impact evaluation. Retrospective studies could also facilitate specification searching and be particularly selected. While others have considered these issues in individual cases, it has been difficult to gauge to what extent the problems are systemic. I use World Bank data on projects that did and did not receive impact evaluations and find a large gap in performance ratings between the projects that received impact evaluations and those that did not. Part of this difference may be a direct effect of the impact evaluations themselves improving project performance, however, part appears due to selection bias. Biases due to retrospective analysis appear largest of all.},

We study this question in the context of Germany between 1929 and 1939. Using geographical and temporal variation in radio availability, we show that radio had a significant negative effect on the Nazi electoral support between 1929 and 1932, when political news were slanted against Nazi party. This effect was reversed in just 5 weeks following Hitler's appointment as chancellor and the transfer of control of the radio to the Nazis. Pro-Nazi radio propaganda caused higher vote for the Nazis in March 1933 election. After full consolidation of power, radio propaganda helped the Nazis to enroll new party members and encouraged denunciations of Jews and other open expressions of anti-Semitism. The effect of Nazi propaganda was not uniform. Depending on listeners' priors about the message, propaganda could be very effective or could backfire. Nazi radio was most effective in places where anti- Semitism was historically high and had a negative effect on the support for anti-Semitic policies in places with historically low anti-Semitism},

abstract = {A number of financial market analysts have argued that the aging of the "Baby Boom" cohort contributed to the rise U.S. asset values during the 1990s, and that asset prices will decline when this group reaches retirement age and begins to draw down its wealth. This paper explores the importance of changing demographic structure for asset returns, asset prices, and the composition of household balance sheets in the United States. Standard models suggest that equilibrium returns on financial assets will vary in response to changes in population age structure. While the direction of the effect of demographic changes is not controversial, the quantitative importance of such changes for financial markets is open to debate. The paper presents several strands of empirical evidence that bear on this issue. First, it describes current age-specific patterns of asset holding in the United States, and finds that asset holdings rise sharply when households are in their 30s and 40s. Aside from the automatic decline in the value of defined benefit pension assets as households age, however, other financial assets decline only gradually during retirement. When these data are used to project asset demands in light of the future age structure of the U.S. population, they do not show a sharp decline in asset demand between 2020 and 2050. This finding calls into question the "asset market meltdown" view. Second, the paper considers the historical association between population age structure and real returns on Treasury bills, long-term government bonds, and corporate stock. The evidence suggests only modest effects, if any, of a changing demographic mix. Statistical tests based on the few effective degrees of freedom in the historical record of age structure and asset returns have limited power to detect such effects. There is a stronger historical correlation between asset levels, as measured for example by the price-dividend ratio, and summary measures of the population age structure. Once again, however, the results are sensitive to choices about econometric specification. These empirical findings provide modest support, at best, for the view that asset prices could decline as the share of households over the age of 65 increases.},

amount X of a public good is the simple sum of the separate amounts
x i produced by the i = 1, ..., I members of the community. But there
are many other possibilities of practical importance. Among them
are: (i) Weakest-link rule, where the socially available amount is
the minimum of the quantities individually provided, and (ii) Best-shot
rule, where the socially available amount is the maximum of the individual
quantities. The former tends to arise in linear situations, where
each individual has a veto on the total to be provided (e.g., if
each is responsible for one link of a chain); the latter tends to
arise when there is a single prize of overwhelming importance for
the community, with any individual's effort having a chance of securing
the prize.

In comparison with the standard Summation formula of ordinary public-good
theory, it is shown that underprovision of the public good tends
to considerably moderated when the Weakest-link function is applicable,
but aggravated when the Best-shot function is applicable. In time
of disaster, where the survival of the community may depend upon
each person's doing his duty, the conditions for applicability of
the Weakest-link rule are approximated. This circumstance explains
the historical observation that disaster conditions tend to elicit
an extraordinary amount of unselfish behavior.},

It takes into account that people evaluate the kindness of an action not only by its consequences but also by its underlying intention. The theory is in line with the relevant stylized facts of a wide range of experimental games, such as the ultimatum game, the gift-exchange game, a reduced best-shot game, the dictator game, the prisoner's dilemma, and public goods games. Furthermore, it predicts that identical consequences trigger different reciprocal responses in different environments. Finally, the theory explains why outcomes tend to be fair in bilateral interactions whereas extremely unfair distributions may arise in competitive markets.},

Since contributions and beliefs move together, indicating that current and/or past values of one series are not useful for predicting future values of the other, I develop and test the hypothesis that contribution heterogeneity predicts changes in average contributions. I find support for my hypothesis using data from a variety of public good game experiments (with and without belief elicitation; fixed and random matching).},

The control treatment is a standard public bad experiment, while in the leader treatments the design is such that in each group the leader decides first on his or her investment in the public bad. After being informed about the leader's decision, the four -{\"{A}}{\`{o}}followers' in each group make their investment decision. Two treatments of the leadership game are played with each group. In the same-leader-costs treatment, all subjects are confronted with the same costs, while in the no-leader-costs treatment the leader faces no direct costs of acting socially. It is found that followers invest significantly less in the public bad when there is a leader compared with a situation when there is no leader. Comparing the two treatments, we find, moreover, that the leadership effect is somewhat stronger when leaders face the same costs as followers compared with the situation in which leaders bear no costs. Randomly chosen leaders set an example by investing less than average players in a standard public bad game, and leader investments are lowest when the costs of leading are low.},

Twenty-two years after the lottery the earnings difference is almost 50 percent. Only a small fraction of this difference can be attributed to differences in working hours and human capital investments.

suggests that the influence of face on social interactions is both
pervasive and powerful in Asia. Face, however, has not gained general
acceptance as an important theoretical concept in the literature
on Asian organizational behavior and management. In this paper, we
propose face as a key variable that can explain much of the complexity
of social interactions in Asian organizations. We attempted to elaborate
on the concept and dynamics of face in Asia in such a way as to capture
its pervasive, significant but often subtle influences on organizational
behavior. We also examined conditions, functions, and consequences
of face dynamics to generate testable propositions for future research.
We argue that scholars have to go beyond the individualistic assumptions
about human behavior implicit in theories of organizational behavior
in the West to better understand the richness of organizational behavior
in Asia. In Asia, organizational behavior is better predicted by
an individual's external attributes such as face than internal attributes
such as desires, emotions, and cognition.},

However, a few jurisdictions have shifted towards defined contribution (DC) plans as their primary savings plan, and fiscal pressures are likely to generate more movement in this direction. Holding fixed a public employee-{\"{A}}{\`{o}}s work and salary history, we show that DB retirement income replacement ratios vary greatly across jurisdictions. This creates large variation in workers-{\"{A}}{\`{o}} need to save for retirement in other accounts. There is also substantial heterogeneity across jurisdictions in the savings generated in primary DC plans because of differences in the level of mandatory employer and employee contributions. One notable difference between public and private sector DC plans is that public sector primary DC plans are characterized by required employee or employer contributions (or both), whereas private sector plans largely feature voluntary employee contributions that are supplemented by an employer match. We conclude by applying lessons from savings behavior in private sector savings plans to the design of public sector plans.},

Our primary specification involves using mother fixed effects-{\"{A}}{\^{i}}comparing the outcomes of two children with the same mother but where a parent of the mother died during one of the pregnancies-{\"{A}}{\^{i}}augmented with a control for whether there is a death around the time of the pregnancy in order to isolate true causal effects of a bereavement during pregnancy. We find small negative effects on birth outcomes, and these effects are bigger for boys than for girls. The effects on birth outcomes seems to be driven by deaths due to cardiovascular causes suggesting that sudden deaths are more difficult to deal with. However, we find no evidence of adverse effects on adult outcomes. The results are robust to alternative specifications.},

are based on moral reasoning is valid with regard to consumer buying
attitudes, as it has been shown to be in other domains of consumer
behaviour. It is proposed that two conditions make moral reasoning
in the buying situation more likely: environmental concern and the
absence of other highly involving characteristics. The paper presents
a study of a case with these two characteristics: Danish consumers'
choice of environment-friendly packaging. With regard to this case,
the evidence supports the claim. A majority of Danish consumers have
developed personal norms about choosing environment-friendly packaging
and the personal norm is a significant predictor of their (self-reported)
propensity to choose environment-friendly packaging in the supermarket
(whereas perceived costs have a minor influence on the choice). It
is recommended that attempts to promote this and similar behaviour
focus on strengthening consumers' intrinsic motivation and on facilitating
its transformation into behaviour.},

abstract = {Despite significant policy efforts to encourage Americans to save for retirement, the U.S. retirement savings rates have declined for more than two decades. Current policies and programs are largely driven by three implicit theories of why people do and do not save: trait theory, life cycle, and education. The authors' purpose is not to identify a singular best theory but rather to demonstrate the need to expand the theories used to address the retirement savings problem. Toward that end, they empirically examine each traditional theory and simultaneously explore the additional power of complementary theories: future-self theory and imagery. The results show that variables grounded in trait theory, life cycle, and education are significantly related to retirement planning. Moreover, people who reported greater and more vivid imagery of a positive future retired self had engaged in more retirement preparation, accounting for a significant amount of variance beyond the traditional theories.},

as quality and development efforts, and student characteristics,
such as quality and wealth. Empirical analysis is complicated by
the expected correlation between institutional quality and student
wealth, and the possible endogeneity between institutional expenditures
on education (one common measure of quality) and the level of alumni
support the institution receives. This paper uses a two-stage least
squares approach with data on quality and variables correlated with
student wealth to address these issues. Quality variables are found
to have a positive impact on the average alumni gift, with that impact
most significant for private universities and liberal arts colleges.
Wealth variables also have a positive impact on the average gift,
with the estimated coefficients most significant for public universities.
Development effort is very important in determining the level of
giving for all three types of institutions.},

abstract = {Decisions involving charitable giving often occur under the shadow of risk. A common finding is that potential donors give less when there is greater risk that their donation will have less impact. While this behavior could be fully rationalized by standard economic models, this paper shows that an additional mechanism is relevant: the use of risk as an excuse not to give. In a laboratory study, participants evaluate risky payoffs for themselves and risky payoffs for a charity. When their decisions do not involve tradeoffs between money for themselves and the charity, they respond very similarly to self risk and charity risk. By contrast, when their decisions force tradeoffs between money for themselves and the charity, participants act more averse to charity risk and less averse to self risk. These altered responses to risk bias participants towards choosing payoffs for themselves more often, consistent with excuse-driven responses to risk. Additional results support the existence of excuse-driven types.},

abstract = {Fear of receiving bad news about one's health can lead people to avoid seeking out health information that, ironically, may be crucial for health maintenance. Using a nationally representative US sample, the present study examined whether perceived likelihood of developing cancer and worry about cancer were associated with reports of avoiding visits to one's doctor, in respondents under and over age 50. Cancer worry, but not perceived risk of cancer, predicted doctor avoidance in respondents aged 50 and older, whereas the opposite pattern held for respondents under age 50. Moreover, in respondents aged 50 and older, cancer worry and perceived cancer risk interacted such that cancer worry was linked to doctor avoidance only when respondents also perceived a high likelihood of cancer. The latter result is consistent with the notion that worry may motivate information seeking when people expect information to dispel worry and information avoidance when the information is seen as highly likely to confirm one's fears. Findings suggest a need for communication strategies that can influence worry and perceived risk differentially. Research should also assess the effectiveness of other behavioral strategies (e.g., automatic scheduling of appointments) as a means for reducing doctor avoidance.},

Peer nominations of rejection, self-report measures of anxious and angry rejection expectations, and social anxiety, social withdrawal, and loneliness were assessed at two time points. Results indicate that peer rejection at Time 1 predicted an increase in anxious and angry expectations of rejection at Time 2, but only for boys. Being liked by peers, irrespective of level of dislike, predicted a reduction in anxious rejection expectations in both boys and girls. Further, anxious expectations of rejection were uniquely predictive of increased social anxiety and withdrawal. Angry expectations of rejection, an established unique predictor of increased aggression, predicted decreased social anxiety. Both anxious and angry expectations predicted increased loneliness, but neither were unique predictors of loneliness. Implications of viewing anxious and angry expectations of rejection as distinct cognitive-affective vulnerabilities for adolescents are discussed.},

Subjects are given a menu of ten charities, with a mix of local and non-local organizations included. We vary whether third-party ratings are displayed on this menu. Subjects perform an effort task to earn money and can choose to donate to their selected charity. We find evidence that subjects' choice of charity is impacted by third-party evaluations but, somewhat surprisingly, there are no obvious preferences for local charities. These third-party assessments have some impact on the percent of earnings that subjects allocate to their selected charity; local charities also accrue more donations, though these results are imprecise.},

abstract = {Abstract: This paper estimates the impact of schooling on the wages
of men. It is important to know what the return on educational investments
might be since a high return implies that there might be too little
of such investments. The major preoccupation in this literature has
been attempting to unravel the simultaneous relationship between
schooling and wages. That is, wages depend on schooling since schooling
enhances human capital, but schooling decisions depend on wages for
one or more of a number of reasons - for example, individuals will
invest in more schooling the greater is the return to that schooling.
Traditional estimates of the return to an additional year of schooling
in the UK suggest that this is in of the order of 7{\%}. However, the
results here suggest much larger figures - perhaps in the order of
20{\%}. We use a large sample of UK males to address the potential endogeneity
of schooling. By exploiting the experimental nature of two changes
in the minimum school leaving age to uncover the effect of an exogenous
increase in schooling on wages. Our results confirm recent US work.
For example, Card (1993) and Butcher and Case (1994) suggest that
the estimates of schooling returns using such methods are almost
double that of simple least squares methods. However, the results
here provide much greater precision than has previously been the
case and so substantiate the US evidence of much larger rates of
return to education than traditionally thought.},

generated along the coffee commodity chain during the period 1971-1995.
Until the late 1980s, coffee growers and producing states retained
over a third of the total income and about half of the total surplus
that was available. This was due in part to the collective actions
of coffee-producing states, which led to the imposition of a regulatory
regime involving export quotas, creating rents for the producing
countries. By the late 1980s, coffee TNCs had consolidated their
control over core markets, and began to use their market power to
increase their shares of both income and surplus. This shift was
greatly accelerated by the breakdown of the export quota regime in
1989. The article concludes that these results necessitate a reformulation
of commodity chain analysis.},

community, this paper investigates the impact of transaction costs
on the institutional structure of exchange. Fish markets in this
region are connected and organized into a hierarchical network. This
structure of fish markets dramatically reduces the cost for geographically
distanced fishermen and consumers to execute trades. However, the
provision of the market itself requires entrepreneurial efforts.
In this study, the market is conceptualized as a continuum of middlemen,
whose entrepreneurial efforts of buying and selling make the market
work. When the middleman makes profits, the market is at work. Otherwise,
the market fails to emerge. Comparing the different ways of organizing
fish transportation at two distinct villages, this paper shows that
the choice of the market or the firm to organize fish transportation
is determined by the cost of putting the market to work.},

abstract = {In this paper we study the problems of estimating heterogeneity in causal effects in experimental or observational studies and conducting inference about the magnitude of the differences in treatment effects across subsets of the population. In applications, our method provides a data-driven approach to determine which subpopulations have large or small treatment effects and to test hypotheses about the differences in these effects. For experiments, our method allows researchers to identify heterogeneity in treatment effects that was not specified in a pre-analysis plan, without concern about invalidating inference due to multiple testing. In most of the literature on supervised machine learning (e.g. regression trees, random forests, LASSO, etc.), the goal is to build a model of the relationship between a unit's attributes and an observed outcome. A prominent role in these methods is played by cross-validation which compares predictions to actual outcomes in test samples, in order to select the level of complexity of the model that provides the best predictive power. Our method is closely related, but it differs in that it is tailored for predicting causal effects of a treatment rather than a unit's outcome. The challenge is that the "ground truth" for a causal effect is not observed for any individual unit: we observe the unit with the treatment, or without the treatment, but not both at the same time. Thus, it is not obvious how to use cross-validation to determine whether a causal effect has been accurately predicted. We propose several novel cross-validation criteria for this problem and demonstrate through simulations the conditions under which they perform better than standard methods for the problem of causal effects. We then apply the method to a large-scale field experiment re-ranking results on a search engine.},

Applying the theoretical perspectives of Behavioural Finance and New Institutionalism to the domain of retirement provision offers insights into the difficulties individuals are facing in planning for retirement, carrying out, and revising plans. Lacking financial literacy seems to lie at the heart of the problem and points to a possible solution: providing financial education to consumers through non-governmental organizations and state-related agencies. This article is examining which role consumer education and consumer advice can play to enhance financial literacy with regard to pensions and old-age provision. As two case studies Germany and the UK are compared because the institutional set-up of the pension systems and the approaches towards consumer policy are very different. The case studies show that financial education with regard to old-age provision can be successful if it reaches consumers in their environment at life-stages where important decisions need to be made. To achieve that considerable efforts have to be taken in terms of funding and organizational set-up. However, evaluation is necessary to prove the effectiveness of the education especially for vulnerable consumer groups. If evaluation reveals that these groups cannot be targeted effectively or that consumers are not taking action subsequently to attending financial education, there might be a case for changing behaviour through the institutional set-up of pension schemes (i.e., through automatic enrollment) and using financial education as a supportive policy instrument.},

Sequential moves result in a larger provision of the public good, because the follower mimics the action of the leader, and in accounting for this response the leader chooses to contribute when it is efficient to do so. An experimental investigation of the game shows that the donors predominantly choose to contribute sequentially, and that the resulting contributions are larger than those of the simultaneous-move game. Although the gain from sequential moves is smaller when the sequence is set exogenously, our results suggest that the involved parties would benefit from having sequential moves imposed upon them.},

They find that the attractiveness of a risky asset depends upon investors' time horizon: consistently with MLA, individuals are more willing to take risks when they evaluate their investments less frequently. This paper shows that these experimental findings can be accommodated by a standard version of Expected Utility Theory, namely a CRRA functional, provided that, consistently with MLA, we impose narrow bracketing. We use four different datasets to estimate two CRRA and two MLA functionals, together with binary mixture models of all combinations of the competing models. Our econometric exercise supports our theoretical claim on narrow bracketing and finds little evidence of subjects' loss aversion.

abstract = {New technologies for innovative interactive experience represent a powerful medium to deliver cultural heritage content to a wider range of users. Among them, Natural User Interfaces (NUI), i.e. non-intrusive technologies not requiring to the user to wear devices nor use external hardware (e.g. keys or trackballs), are considered a promising way to broader the audience of specific cultural heritage domains, like the navigation/interaction with digital artworks presented on wall-sized displays. Starting from a collaboration with a worldwide famous Italian designer, we defined a NUI to explore 360 panoramic artworks presented on wall-sized displays, like virtual reconstruction of ancient cultural sites, or rendering of imaginary places. Specifically, we let the user to "move the head" as way of natural interaction to explore and navigate through these large digital artworks. To this aim, we developed a system including a remote head pose estimator to catch movements of users standing in front of the wall-sized display: starting from a central comfort zone, as users move their head in any direction, the virtual camera rotates accordingly. With NUIs, it is difficult to get feedbacks from the users about the interest for the point of the artwork he/she is looking at. To solve this issue, we complemented the gaze estimator with a preliminary emotional analysis solution, able to implicitly infer the interest of the user for the shown content from his/her pupil size. A sample of 150 subjects was invited to experience the proposed interface at an International Design Week. Preliminary results show that the most of the subjects were able to properly interact with the system from the very first use, and that the emotional module is an interesting solution, even if further work must be devoted to address specific situations. {\textcopyright} 2016 for this paper by its authors.

Abstract In 2005, a drastic reform in the Israeli capital market shifted the power to choose savings vehicles from employers to individuals. Using a unique dataset from a large employer, this event provides us a rare window into individuals' savings decisions and the effect of their social environment. In the first year following the reform's implementation, 7{\%} of the employees switched out of the fund in which they all previously saved. Choice of fund was not associated with observable measures of fund performance, but was strongly affected by the employees' social environment. Exploiting within-department variation in peer groups, we find that savings decisions were strongly influenced by the choices of co-workers from the same ethnic group. Interviews also point to the influence of non-professional colleagues.},

We study this question in the context of Germany between 1929 and 1939. Using geographical and temporal variation in radio availability, we show that radio had a significant negative effect on the Nazi electoral support between 1929 and 1932, when political news were slanted against Nazi party. This effect was reversed in just 5 weeks following Hitler's appointment as chancellor and the transfer of control of the radio to the Nazis. Pro-Nazi radio propaganda caused higher vote for the Nazis in March 1933 election. After full consolidation of power, radio propaganda helped the Nazis to enroll new party members and encouraged denunciations of Jews and other open expressions of anti-Semitism. The effect of Nazi propaganda was not uniform. Depending on listeners' priors about the message, propaganda could be very effective or could backfire. Nazi radio was most effective in places where anti-Semitism was historically high and had a negative effect on the support for anti-Semitic policies in places with historically low anti-Semitism.},

The model also suggests that dynamic preferences promote the use of JPE or RPE at the expense of independent performance evaluation (IPE) if the principal cannot use IPE to boost social preferences.},

heterogeneous firm models by examining stock market reactions to
the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement of 1989 (CUSFTA). Using
the uncertainty surrounding the agreement's ratification, I show
that the pattern of abnormal returns of Canadian manufacturing firms
was broadly consistent with the predictions of a class of models
based on Melitz (2003). Increases in the likelihood of ratification
led to stock market gains of exporting firms relative to non-exporters.
Moreover, gains were higher in sectors with larger cuts in U.S. import
tariffs. Decreases in the likelihood of ratification led to opposite
stock market reactions. Results for the impact of Canadian tariff
reductions are less conclusive but most specifications suggest that
exporters also gained relative to non-exporters in response to such
reductions. Translating stock market gains into implied profit changes,
I find that CUSFTA increased expected per-period profits of exporters
by around 6-7{\%} relative to non-exporters.},

We found that providing people with the opportunity to give increases donations, while which people will donate is conditional on the type of request made. Furthermore, we found some support for the argument that organizations receive more donations from people that have specific incentives (social status motives, religious and political values) to donate to these organizations. Finally, only organizations striving for difficult goals receive more donations from people with higher levels of confidence. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

economic outcomes. We incorporate the psychology and sociology of
identity into an economic model of behavior. In the utility function
we propose, identity is associated with different social categories
and how people in these categories should behave. We then construct
a simple game-theoretic model showing how identity can affect individual
interactions. The paper adapts these models to gender discrimination
in the workplace, the economics of poverty and social exclusion,
and the household division of labor. In each case, the inclusion
of identity substantively changes conclusions of previous economic
analysis.},

abstract = {People respond to those who ask. Within the charitable fundraising community, the power of the ask represents the backbone of most fundraising strategies. Despite this, the optimal design of communication strategies has received less formal attention. For their part, economists have recently explored how communication affects empathy, altruism, and giving rates to charities. Our study takes a step back from this literature to examine how suggestions-a direct ask for a certain amount of money-affect giving rates. We find that our suggestion amounts affect both the intensive and extensive margins: more people give and they tend to give the suggested amount. The resulting insights help us understand why people give, why messages work, and deepen practitioners' understanding of how to use messages to leverage more giving. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Numerous recommendations for improving the dependability of research findings in psychological science have emerged in recent years. Unfortunately, this glut of recommendations proves problematic for advancing uniform solutions to improve research dependability by individuals within and across the various constituencies that comprise psychological science. Moreover, several dependability recommen-dations propose practices to address the problem of false positive findings that can inversely increase the problem of false negative findings, and vice versa. It is proposed that the solution to this conundrum is to develop a concise and concrete list of core research dependability recommendations that address problems of false positive and false negative findings in a noncontradicting manner. Examination of the current research dependability literature and earlier literatures dealing with the problem of false findings is used to arrive at a set of three core research dependability recommendations: (a) conduct and promote direct replication studies; (b) ensure data sharing when requested by fellow scientists; and (c) adopt and promote a truth seeking mindset during the research endeavor. A recent confluence of factors, including high-profile cases of research fraud by psychologists, questions regarding the depend-ability and replicability of scientific results, and concerns about the use of questionable research practices, has contributed to the emergence of a new movement to improve the scientific integrity of psychological science (Asendorpf et al., 2013; Funder et al., The primary goals of this movement, which I will refer to as the research dependability movement, are to illuminate problems in contempo-rary psychological science that undermine the integrity of empir-ical findings and to present potential solutions for how to address these problems. The movement appears to be gaining momentum as indicated by changes in the editorial policies of various prom-inent journals that appear designed to promote greater dependabil-ity in published findings (for several examples, see editorial pol-icies at Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Journal of Research in Personality, and Psychological Science). Increasing support for the movement has spawned numerous commentaries that seek to address the dependability problem (e.g., Ledgerwood, 2014a, 2014b, and accompanying special section articles; Makel, 2014, and accompanying special section articles; Pashler {\&} Wangenmakers, 2012, and accompanying special section articles; Spellman, 2012, and accompanying special section articles). Although several attempts to integrate solutions into comprehensive lists have been attempted (e.g., Asendorpf et al., 2013; Cumming, 2014; Funder et al., 2014), the number of proposed solutions and recommendations is growing quite large. A sampling of such recommendations based on a casual reading of various research dependability commentaries is provided in Table 1. Unfortunately, this glut of recommendations for improving re-search dependability has created several problems. First, the high number of recommendations is overwhelming for those hoping to implement meaningful changes in their own research activities or training programs. Second, the high number of recommendations makes it challenging to coordinate meaningful responses within and across constituencies that make up psychological science (i.e., researchers, journal editors and reviewers, administrators of re-search support institutions, and educators). Together, these prob-lems are fairly obvious in their potential impact: too many recom-mendations make it difficult to address research dependability challenges in a manner that is uniform among individuals within and across different constituencies. However, a third less obvious problem exists with the numerous research dependability recommendations. Specifically, many are based on concerns that arise from two earlier movements in psychological methodology and statistics that rest on somewhat contradictory assumptions. When these recommendations are un-critically blended under the research dependability umbrella, they may promote conflicting behaviors that undermine the very goals the dependability movement seeks to achieve. Given these problems, the purpose of the present commentary is to arrive at a concise list of core recommendations to improve the integrity of psychological science. This process was based on three guiding principles. First, and most importantly, core recommen-dations should be internally consistent in that they should lead to nonconflicting outcomes in addressing research dependability is-sues. Second, the number of recommendations should be small and},

Yet many real life situations involve insiders, who are directly affected by a dilemma, and outsiders, who may be harmed if the insiders overcome the dilemma. The quintessential illustration is oligopoly. If insiders overcome their dilemma and collude, this inflicts harm on the opposite market side. In our experiment, harm on outsiders significantly reduces conditional cooperation of insiders. We can exclude that this result is driven by inequity aversion, reciprocity or efficiency seeking. Only guilt aversion can rationalize our findings, with guilt being most pronounced if the active insiders not only inflict harm on the outsider, but increase their own payoff at the expense of the outsider.},

This paper presents evidence on how individuals behave in donation
experiments and how the

same individuals behave in a naturally occurring decision situation
on charitable giving. The

results show that behavior in experiments is correlated with behavior
in the field. The results are

robust to variations in the experimental setting, and the correlation
between experimental and

field behavior is between 0.25 and 0.4. We discuss whether this correlation
should be interpreted

as strong or weak and what consequences the findings have for experimental

abstract = {Dozens of markets of all types are in the early stages of a revolution
as the Internet and related technologies vastly expand the variety
of products that can be produced, promoted and purchased. Although
this revolution is based on a simple set of economic and technological
drivers, the authors argue that its implications are far-reaching
for managers, consumers and the economy as a whole. This article
looks at what has been dubbed the "Long Tail" phenomenon, examining
how customers derive value from an important characteristic of Internet
markets: the ability of online merchants to help consumers locate,
evaluate and purchase a far wider range of products than they can
typically buy via the traditional brick-and-mortar channels.


The article examines the Long Tail from both the supply side and the
demand side and identifies several key drivers. On the supply side,
the authors point out how e-tailers' expanded, centralized warehousing
allows for more offerings, thus making it possible for them to cater
to more varied tastes. On the demand side, tools such as search engines,
recommender software and sampling tools are allowing customers to
find products outside of their geographic area. The authors also
look toward the future to discuss second order amplified effects
of Long Tail, including the growth of markets serving smaller niches.},

abstract = {In our model of ethical product differentiation two duopolists compete
over prices and (costly) {\^{A}}-socially and environmentally responsible{\^{A}}-

to reduce the price after the ethical producer's entry when his (non
ethical) location is fixed. His optimal price is halfway between
his zero profit price and the zero profit price of the ethical producer.
By removing the fixed location hypothesis we find that the ethical
producer{\^{A}}'s entry has positive indirect effects on aggregate social
and environmental responsibility since the incumbent finds it optimal
to imitate him when consumers{\^{A}}' perception of ethical costs is sufficiently
high.


In the paper we also show that the solution of the three-stage game
- in which location and prices are simultaneously chosen and the
profit maximising producer is Stackelberg leader in location {\^{A}}- has
three main features: minimum price differentiation, ethical imitation
and non minimal ethical differentiation. We explain the differences
between these findings and those from a traditional Hotelling game
as depending from three main features: i) the different goals of
the two (profit maximising and zero profit) competitors; ii) the
asymmetry in costs of "ethical" distance and iii) the lack of independence
between ethical location and prices.},

abstract = {The problem of sustaining a public resource that everybody is free
to overuse-the 'tragedy of the commons'-emerges in many social dilemmas,
such as our inability to sustain the global climate. Public goods
experiments, which are used to study this type of problem, usually
confirm that the collective benefit will not be produced. Because
individuals and countries often participate in several social games
simultaneously, the interaction of these games may provide a sophisticated
way by which to maintain the public resource. Indirect reciprocity,
'give and you shall receive', is built on reputation and can sustain
a high level of cooperation, as shown by game theorists. Here we
show, through alternating rounds of public goods and indirect reciprocity
games, that the need to maintain reputation for indirect reciprocity
maintains contributions to the public good at an unexpectedly high
level. But if rounds of indirect reciprocation are not expected,
then contributions to the public good drop quickly to zero. Alternating
the games leads to higher profits for all players. As reputation
may be a currency that is valid in many social games, our approach
could be used to test social dilemmas for their solubility.},

In each case, we find that the motive sometimes does not apply in situations where practitioners often assume it does.},

abstract = {Medical Education 2011: 45: 1032-1040 Objectives- A recent controlled study by our group showed that the dropout rate in the first 2-years of study of medical students selected for entry by the assessment of a combination of non-cognitive and cognitive abilities was 2.6 times lower than that of a control group of students admitted by lottery. The aim of the present study was to compare the performance of these two groups in the clinical phase. Methods- A prospective cohort study was performed to compare the performance of 389 medical students admitted by selection with that of 938 students admitted by weighted lottery between 2001 and 2004. Follow-up of these cohorts lasted 5.5-8.5-years. The main outcome measures were the mean grade obtained on the first five discipline-specific clerkships by all cohorts and the mean grade achieved on all 10 clerkships by the cohorts of 2001 and 2002. Results- Selected students obtained a significantly higher mean grade during their first five clerkships than lottery-admitted students (mean----standard error [SE] 7.95----0.03, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 7.90-8.00 versus mean----SE 7.84----0.02, 95{\%} CI 7.81-7.87; p--0.001). This difference reflected the fact that selected students achieved a grade of ---8.0 1.5 times more often than lottery-admitted students. An analysis of all mean grades awarded on 10 clerkships revealed the same results. Moreover, the longer follow-up period over the clerkships showed that the relative risk for dropout was twice as low in the selected student group as in the lottery-admitted student group. Conclusions- The selected group received significantly higher mean grades on their first five clerkships, which could not be attributed to factors other than the selection procedure. Although the risk for dropout before the clinical phase increased somewhat in both groups, the actual dropout rate proved to be twice as low in the selected group.},

abstract = {First-degree price discrimination, or person-specific pricing, had until recently rarely been observed. The reason, that reservation values were unobtainable, may no longer be true now that massive datasets tracking detailed individual behavior exist. Hence, a fundamental change in the way goods are priced may be underway. I investigate this claim in one context. I show demographics, which in the past could be used to personalize prices, poorly predict which consumers subscribe to Netflix. By contrast, modern web- browsing data, with variables such as visits to Amazon.com and internet use on Tuesdays - variables which reflect behavior - do substantially better. I then present a model to estimate demand and simulate outcomes had 1st degree PD been implemented. The model is structural, derived from canonical theory models, but resembles an ordered Probit, allowing a new method for handling massive datasets and addressing overfitting and high dimensionality. Simulations show using demographics alone to tailor prices raises profits by 0.8{\%}. Including nearly 5000 potential website browsing explanatory variables increases profits by much more, 12.2{\%}, increasingly the appeal of tailored pricing, and resulting in some consumers paying double the price others do for the exact same product. Implications for the overall economy and its structure are discussed. (JEL: D42, L130)},

giving, in particular, price and income elasticities. We find that
many of the most often reported results from this literature rely
on a model specification that is inappropriate when applied to recent
Federal Tax File data. We develop a standard Tobit model with a Box-Cox
transformation parameter that nests a number of other specifications.
The Box-Cox model yields estimates of price elasticities and expected
charitable contributions that differ from those obtained using the
typical specification. Additionally, we find that the use of sample
weights provides potentially important policy insights.},

abstract = {{Previous research on gender differences in behavior has led to seemingly contradictory findings. While some authors report that women are more generous than men, others report the opposite relative patterns of behavior. From data generated by 202 subject pairs, we find that women are more sensitive than men to the costs of generous actions when deciding whether or not to be generous. The factors that affect the level of generosity observed in our experiments are reciprocal motivation, the level of money payoffs, and the level of social distance in the experimental protocol. The relatively greater sensitivity of women to the costs of generous behavior can explain some of the apparent inconsistencies of previously-reported findings. ... At first, the results of Andreoni and Vesterlund (2001) appear at odds with our findings but upon closer inspection these findings are actually consistent. In that study, subjects allocated tokens between themselves and a counterpart. The exchange rate at which the tokens could be redeemed for cash was role specific. By varying these exchange rates and the number of tokens, Andreoni and Vesterlund observed decisions across eight distinct budget constraints. Budget {\#}5 corresponds to the standard dictator game of dividing 10 and for this game they find no gender difference. This treatment is similar to our DS treatment where we also found no significant gender difference. Their budget {\#}{\}}4 corresponds to a standard dictator game involving less money, 6. With this parameterization they report that women are more generous than men, as would be predicted by our results since the payoff level is decreased while holding the social distance and the (absence of) reciprocal motivation constant},

abstract = {In our model of ethical product differentiation two duopolists (a
zero profit socially concerned producer and a profit maximizing

producer) compete over prices and (costly) -socially and environmentally
responsible- features of their products under a

given law of motion of consumer' habits.


In a continuous time model in which the location of the zero profit
social responsible entrant is fixed and the profit maximizing producer
(PMP) limits himself to price competition without ethical imitation,
we show that the optimal dynamic PMP's price is always lower than
his optimal static price since the PMP producer knows that, by leaving
too much market share to the other producer, he will reinforce the
habit of socially responsible consumption and loose further market
share in the future. We inspect the properties of equilibria when
the PMP can ethically

imitate the entrant and when the entrant is free to choose his location.
We find that, in the first case, the threshold

triggering a PMP strategy of ethical imitation and minimum price differentiation
is lower in the dynamic than in the static case,

depending on the PMP's shadow cost of changes in consumers social
responsibility.},

First, the author looks for crowding out in the opposite direction: increased private funding may cause reduced public funding. Second, the author tests whether one type of funding acts as a signal of charity quality and thus crowds in other funding. The author finds evidence that government grants crowd in private donations. Crowding in is larger for younger charities. This is consistent with signaling, if donors know less about younger charities and the signal value is stronger.

Although university graduates are particularly mobile, we find that most of them do not move from their region of studies within 10 years after graduation. The out-migration, i.e., brain drain, is much higher among graduates in the more peripheral universities than in the growth centers (Helsinki in particular). Migration is also substantially more likely for those studying away from the home region than for those studying at home.},

While these procedures differ in the criteria applied for admission they all make use of priority matching. In priority matching schemes, it is not a dominant strategy for students to submit their true preferences. Thus, strategic behaviour is expected. Using the full data set of applicants, we are able to detect some amount of strategic behaviour which can lead to inefficient matching.

Results indicate that peer rejection at Time 1 predicted an increase in anxious and angry expectations of rejection at Time 2, but only for boys. Being liked by peers, irrespective of level of dislike, predicted a reduction in anxious rejection expectations in both boys and girls. Further, anxious expectations of rejection were uniquely predictive of increased social anxiety and withdrawal. Angry expectations of rejection, an established unique predictor of increased aggression, predicted decreased social anxiety. Both anxious and angry expectations predicted increased loneliness, but neither were unique predictors of loneliness. Implications of viewing anxious and angry expectations of rejection as distinct cognitive-affective vulnerabilities for adolescents are discussed.},

abstract = {Despite a long tradition of using lotteries, raffles and similar mechanisms to fund public goods, there has been little systematic study of the design features of these mechanisms and how the resulting incentives affect the level of provision. Partnering with a charity that provides public goods locally, we conducted a field experiment in which participants were randomly assigned to one of four raffle treatments to examine the effectiveness of alternative incentive schemes designed to encourage either participation or -volume.- Contrary to theory which anticipates that gains can be made mostly on volume, our results indicate that significant revenue gains are available on both margins. Indeed, the large opportunity cost of using the standard linear raffle (in which the price per chance to win is fixed) that we find suggests the importance of mechanism design when considering the voluntary provision of public goods.},

@article{Abramowicz2004a,
abstract = {FutureMAP, a project of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,
was to involve experiments to determine whether information markets
could improve Defense Department decisionmaking. Information markets
are securities markets used to derive information from the prices
of securities whose liquidation values are contingent on future events.
The government intended to use such a market to assess the probabilities
of potential political assassinations, and the indelicacy of this
potential application contributed to a controversy leading to the
cancellation of the program. In this Article, Professor Abramowicz
assesses whether information markets in theory could be useful to
administrative agencies, and it concludes that information markets
could help discipline administrative agency predictions, but only
if a number of technical hurdles such as the danger of manipulation
can be overcome. Because the predictions of well-functioning information
markets are objective, they function as a tool that exhibits many
of the same virtues in predictive tasks that cost- benefit analysis
offers for normative policy evaluation. Both approaches can help
to overcome cognitive errors, thwart interest group manipulation,
and discipline administrative agency decisionmaking. The Article
suggests that the two forms of analysis might be combined to produce
a -predictive cost-benefit analysis.- In such an analysis, an information
market would predict the outcome of a retrospective cost- benefit
analysis, to be conducted some years after the decision whether to
enact a particular policy. As long as the identity of the eventual
decisionmaker cannot be anticipated, predictive cost-benefit analysis
estimates how an average decisionmaker would be expected to evaluate
the policy. Because the predictive cost-benefit analysis assessment
is not dependent on the identity of current agency officials, they
cannot shade the numbers to justify policies that the officials prefer
for idiosyncratic or ideological reasons.},

generated along the coffee commodity chain during the period 1971-1995.
Until the late 1980s, coffee growers and producing states retained
over a third of the total income and about half of the total surplus
that was available. This was due in part to the collective actions
of coffee-producing states, which led to the imposition of a regulatory
regime involving export quotas, creating rents for the producing
countries. By the late 1980s, coffee TNCs had consolidated their
control over core markets, and began to use their market power to
increase their shares of both income and surplus. This shift was
greatly accelerated by the breakdown of the export quota regime in
1989. The article concludes that these results necessitate a reformulation
of commodity chain analysis.},

We find small negative effects on birth outcomes, and these effects are bigger for boys than for girls. The effects on birth outcomes seems to be driven by deaths due to cardiovascular causes suggesting that sudden deaths are more difficult to deal with. However, we find no evidence of adverse effects on adult outcomes. The results are robust to alternative specifications.},

We analyse in detail the qualitative properties of the model's solution and show by construction that our results exhaust the implications of the model for equilibrium contract pairs.

Moreover, we targeted specific groups that were less likely to save and contribute to supplementary pensions, such as women and low-income employees. The program we developed is not only effective but also inexpensive. While this program was implemented at a single institution, it is suitable to be applied to a variety of employers and demographic groups.},

abstract = {What drives the perceptions of pension savings adequacy and what do workers expect to receive when they retire ? These questions are assessed among married workers using an identical survey distributed to Dutch and American workers in 2007. Despite marked differences in expected pension replacement rates - where the Dutch replacement rates are systematically higher than the American rates - the perceived savings adequacy is more or less the same across Dutch and American workers. In both countries, about half of the respondents were confident they had amassed sufficient retirement savings. Individuals' perceived savings adequacy was found to be influenced by three groups of factors : trust in pension institutions (pension funds, banks, insurance companies and governments), social forces and psychological dispositions. This study shows that differences in the dispositions of workers (with respect to future orientation and financial planning) played a far larger role in explaining differences in perceptions of savings adequacy in the United States than in The Netherlands. Dutch workers rely and trust their pension fund and seem to leave thinking about and planning for retirement to its managers. KEY},

A sample of 134 economists completed a self-report survey examining the decision process of different decision contexts in life, including pension decisions. Overall, participants showed low motivation to engage in the process of choosing a private pension plan, compared to their motivation to engage in other decision tasks. However, economists invested more in the decision process and showed greater satisfaction from their decision regarding their pension plan when they had a more positive perception of pensions. This perception is represented by higher subjective likelihood of receiving pension allowances for a long period, and by a profitable view of the balance between current payments and expected incomes from pension saving.},

that social pressure affects the level of charitable contributions.
We find, however, that the form of the pressure is an important determinant
of the size of health contributions. Personal forms of solicitation
appear to increase contributions, relative to impersonal forms such
as media advertisements and mail campaigns. Within the class of personal
solicitations, we find that pressure to give which is exerted by
friends is more effective than requrests by strangers. Limited evidence
was also found that some workplace relationships result in more effective
fund-raising when compared to solicitations by strangers.},

Gradually increasing victim identifiability in the helping situations primarily affected emotional reactions and sympathy completely mediated the IVE. Gradually making the reference-group smaller primarily affected perceived impact, and impact completely mediated the PDE. Gradually increasing in-groupness primarily affected perceived responsibility, and responsibility completely mediated the IGE. Study 4 included real monetary allocations and largely replicated the results using a between-subject design. Together, the results shed light on how contextual factors trigger help motivation, and indicate that different helping effects are primarily mediated by different mechanisms.},

to dominate the "earnings-effect." Doctoral degree alumni have the
highest giving profile among graduate school alumni. Racial desegregation
of the university is positively and strongly related to alumni giving.

abstract = {A person's willingness to sacrifice for others is highly sensitive
to informational conditions,

but it is unclear why. I conceptually and experimentally distinguish
between three leading

explanations, all based upon beliefs about the giver, which previous
work has not adequately

distinguished. 1) Social-signaling holds that a person wants others
to think of her as fair-

minded, 2) self-signaling says she would like to think of herself
that way, and 3) beliefs-based

altruism says that she cares about how her action makes another person
feel. I present a model

in which the decision-maker signals her preferences to an observer,
which can correspond to each

of these motivations. I experimentally test these interpretations
using the model's predictions

about a dictator game in which the outcome may be determined either
by the dictator's choice

or by chance. Limiting the recipient's ability to infer the dictator's
choice lowers the frequency

of giving, which is evidence of either social-signaling or beliefs-based
altruism. However, I

find little willingness to pay to in uence a recipient's beliefs about
how he was treated by a

third-party dictator, providing little support for belief-based altruism,
and revealing partial

information about the dictator's identity, while holding constant
the recipient's information

about his treatment, increases the frequency and amount of giving,
suggesting social-signaling.

Finally, lowering the expected cost of the decision to give by decreasing
the likelihood that it

will be implemented has little effect on dictator giving when the
beliefs of the recipient are

held constant, offering little support for self-signaling. This suggests
that the act of giving is

largely tied to what it says to others about the giver, as opposed
to the self, or how it makes

the recipient feel.},

We find significant impact on the number of donors and amounts donated consistent with sympathy biases such as the "identifiable victim," "in-group" and "reference dependence." A monthly reframing of the ask amount increases donors and amount donated relative to daily reframing. A second experiment targeted to past donors, finds that the effect of sympathy bias on giving is smaller in percentage terms but statistically and economically highly significant in terms of the magnitude of additional dollars raised. Methodologically, the paper complements the work of behavioral scholars by adopting an empirical researchers' lens of measuring relative effect sizes and economic relevance of multiple behavioral theoretical constructs in the sympathy bias and charity domain within one field setting. This can provide guidance to managers on which behavioral theories are most managerially and economically relevant when developing advertising content.},

abstract = {When and how should a fundraiser ask for a donation from an individual facing an uncertain bonus income? A standard model of expected utility over outcomes predicts that the individual's before choice - her ex-ante commitment conditional on her income - will be the same as her choice after the income has been revealed. Deciding -if you win, how much will you donate?- involves a commitment (i) over a donation for a state of the world that may not be realized and (ii) over uncertain income. Models involving reference-dependent utility, tangibility, and self-signaling predict more giving before, while theories of affect predict more giving after. In our online field experiment at a UK university, as well as in our laboratory experiments in Germany, charitable giving was significantly larger in the Before treatment than in the After treatment for male subjects, with a significant gender differential. Lab treatments isolated distinct mechanisms: for men, donations were higher in all treatments where the donation's collection was uncertain, whether or not the income was known. This supports a (self)-signaling explanation: commitments realized with a lower probability must involve larger amounts to have the same signaling power. Our results are directly relevant to fundraising and volunteer-recruitment strategies, and offer further evidence that we need to exercise caution in applying expected-utility theory in the presence of social preferences},

@article{Sarvary1997,
abstract = {Selling information that is later used in decision making constitutes
an increasingly important business in modern economies (Jensen 1991).
Information is sold under a large variety of forms: industry reports,
consulting services, database access, and/or professional opinions
given by medical, engineering, accounting/financial, and legal professionals,
among others. This paper is the first attempt in marketing to study
competition in the rapidly emerging information sector. Specifically,
we are interested in answering the following questions: (1) Is competition
fundamentally different when competing firms sell information rather
than traditional goods and services, and-if yes-why? (2) What are
the implications of such differences for decision makers (marketers
and regulators)? (3) Can we explain some of the observed marketing
strategies in the information industry? As such, the audience of
the paper includes academics as well as professionals who are interested
in understanding what is specific about competition in information
markets. Familiarity with the practical implications of such differences
and understanding of the mechanisms that drive them is essential
for those who are faced with the problem of marketing information.
To answer the above research questions we build a simple game-theoretic
model that consists of two firms selling information to a population
of consumers who are heterogeneous in their willingness to pay for
the quality of information. The most important features of the model
are the following. Information products sold by the two firms are
modeled as random draws from two normal distributions having equal
mean. The variances of these distributions and their correlatedness
constitute the product-attribute space, which is assumed to be common
knowledge. Consumers are interested in assessing the mean of the
distributions and to do so they can buy the sample from any of the
firms or they can buy both samples and combine them to obtain a more
accurate estimate. Quality of information is linked to the accuracy
of consumers' estimate of the mean which in turn is influenced by
the accuracy of each sample as well as by their correlatedness. Consumers'
utility depends on the quality of information they purchased, on
their inherent utility for quality (taste), and on the total price
they paid to acquire information. Knowing consumer preferences, firms
simultaneously price their information products. The main finding
of the paper is that information markets face unique competitive
structures. In particular, the qualitative nature of competition
changes depending on basic product characteristics. While traditional
products and services compete either as substitutes or as complements
in the relevant product-attribute space, information may be one or
the other, depending on its position within the same product-attribute
space. Said differently, the nature of competition changes qualitatively
with a continuous change in basic product-attribute levels. The intuition
behind this finding is the following. When purchasing information,
consumers facing important decisions may find it beneficial to purchase
from several information sellers. This is more likely to happen when
the reliability of information is low and the sources of information
are independent. Under such conditions information products tend
to be complements and, as a result, competition between sellers is
relatively mild. In the opposite case, when information is reliable
and/or sellers' sources are highly correlated, consumers are satisfied
after consulting a single source. In this case, information products
are substitutes and sellers tend to undercut one another's prices
to induce consumers to choose their brand. Understanding this discontinuity
in competitive structures has important implications for decision
makers as very different strategies are optimal under different product
characteristics. Under substitution, traditional strategies to avoid
competition (e.g., differentiation) are recommended. When the competing
products' reliability is generally low (they are complements) firms
are better off accommodating competition. In fact, we find that a
firm may benefit from "inviting" a competitor. Finally, our findings
are also important for regulators of information markets. As the
literature on complementarity suggests, price fixing agreements between
firms offering complementary products may benefit firms as well as
consumers.},

@article{Kahneman1979a,
abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 1979 The Econometric Society},

The model also suggests that dynamic preferences promote the use of JPE or RPE at the expense of independent performance evaluation (IPE) if the principal cannot use IPE to boost social preferences.},

While these procedures differ in the criteria applied for admission they all make use of priority matching. In priority matching schemes, it is not a dominant strategy for students to submit their true preferences. Thus, strategic behaviour is expected. Using the full data set of applicants, we are able to detect some amount of strategic behaviour which can lead to inefficient matching.

abstract = {We describe the -evaluability bias-: the tendency to weight the importance of an attribute in proportion to its ease of evaluation. We propose that the evaluability bias influences decision making in the context of charitable giving: people tend to have a strong preference for charities with low overhead ratios (lower administrative expenses) but not for charities with high cost-effectiveness (greater number of saved lives per dollar), because the former attribute is easier to evaluate than the latter. In line with this hypothesis, we report the results of four studies showing that, when presented with a single charity, people are willing to donate more to a charity with low overhead ratio, regardless of cost-effectiveness. However, when people are presented with two charities simultaneously-thereby enabling comparative evaluation-they base their donation behavior on cost-effectiveness (Study 1). This suggests that people primarily value cost-effectiveness but manifest the evaluability bias in cases where they find it difficult to evaluate. However, people seem also to value a low overhead ratio for its own sake (Study 2). The evaluability bias effect applies to charities of different domains (Study 3). We also show that overhead ratio is easier to evaluate when its presentation format is a ratio, suggesting an inherent reference point that allows meaningful interpretation (Study 4).},

abstract = {People are more likely to contribute to a charity when they are asked to. Although this so-called -power of asking' is well-known among fundraisers, the existing literature does not pay much attention to the role of donation requests in charitable giving. This paper uses a unique survey that includes a question on whether the respondent is asked to give to estimate the causal effects of charitable solicitations on giving behavior. In order to address the endogeneity of the donation requests due to non-random solicitation of charitable donors, I link this survey to IRS data on charitable organizations and propose identifying instruments. After controlling for the endogeneity, I find that donation requests increase the propensity to give by about nineteen percentage points for those who are asked to give. This effect is robust under different specifications and with different sets of instruments, and is much larger than the estimates from univariate models, which assume that charitable solicitations are exogenous. I argue that this result is counterintuitive and discuss some possible explanations.},

abstract = {We report the results of a field experiment conducted in conjunction with a mailed fundraising campaign of a nonprofit organization. The experiment is designed to compare the response of donors to subsidies in the form of matching amounts or rebated amounts. Matching subsidies are used by many corporations as an employee benefit; the US federal tax system encourages giving using a rebate subsidy by making donations tax deductible. The design includes a control group and two levels of subsidy of each type. Our main result is that matching subsidies result in larger total donations to charities than rebate subsidies, a result that is qualitatively similar to the lab findings. The estimated price elasticities for the matching subsidy are very similar to (and insignificantly different from) the lab experiments, while rebate subsidies lead to lower contributions in the field than in the lab. Since rebates in the field involve substantial lags and additional complications as compared with the "instant rebates" of the lab, this latter difference is not unexpected. The matching results are an important step in validating lab estimates of responsiveness to subsidies of charitable giving.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Across the social sciences, growing concerns about research transparency have led to calls for pre-analysis plans (PAPs) that specify in advance how researchers intend to analyze the data they are about to gather. PAPs promote transparency and credibility by helping readers distinguish between exploratory and confirmatory analyses. However, PAPs are time-consuming to write and may fail to anticipate contingencies that arise in the course of data collection. This article proposes the use of -standard operating procedures- (SOPs)-default practices to guide decisions when issues arise that were not anticipated in the PAP. We offer an example of an SOP that can be adapted by other researchers seeking a safety net to support their PAPs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The existing literature documents that charitable giving is very responsive to tax subsidies, but often ignores the spillover effects of such policies. This paper investigates the spillover effects of charitable subsidies on religious participation using a newly available individual-level panel data. Understanding these spillover effects may be quite important, given the existing literature that links religiosity to several economically important social behaviors. The results show that religious giving and participation are complements. Increasing the price of religious giving decreases not only religious contributions but also religious attendance. The implied cross-price elasticity of religious participation with respect to the after-tax price of giving is -0.27. Furthermore, a 1{\%} increase in the amount of religious contributions is associated with a 0.4{\%} increase in religious attendance. These results are robust under several different specifications and highlight the positive externalities created by charitable subsidies. They also have important implications for testing the validity of existing economic models of religious participation and giving.},

abstract = {Recent theories endogenize the attitude endowments of individuals,
assuming that they are shaped by the attitudes of parents and other
role models. This paper tests empirically for the relevance of three
aspects of the attitude transmission process highlighted in this
theoretical literature: (1) transmission of attitudes from parents
to children; (2) an impact of prevailing attitudes in the local environment
on child attitudes; and (3) positive assortative mating of parents,
which enhances the ability of a parent to pass on his or her attitudes
to the child. We focus on two fundamentally important attitudes,
willingness to take risks and willingness to trust others. We find
empirical support for all three aspects, providing an empirical underpinning
for the literature. An investigation of underlying mechanisms shows
that socialization is important in the transmission process. Various
parental characteristics and aspects of family structure are found
to strengthen the socialization process, with implications for modeling
the socialization production function and for policies focused on
affecting children's non-cognitive skills. The paper also provides
evidence that the transmission of risk and trust attitudes affects
a wide variety of child outcomes, implying a potentially large total
effect on children's economic situation.},

abstract = {How do charitable donors respond to the third party ratings that signal the quality of charities? I investigate this question using a novel data set from Charity Navigator which provides quality ratings for 5400 charities. Since Charity Navigator prominently displays a charity------{\O}s star rating which is assigned based on its overall rating, one can identify the causal impact of a one star increase in ratings on charitable contributions with a regression discontinuity framework that exploits the threshold values of the overall ratings. I find that in general, the third party ratings have a minor and often insignificant impact on charitable contributions received by charities. However, for relatively smaller and unknown charities, a higher rating leads to an increase in charitable contributions received. In particular, for these charities, I find that a one star increase in ratings is associated with a 19.5 percent increase in the amount of charitable contributions received. This result is robust under alternative model specifications and highlights the role of the third party ratings in not-for-profit markets.},

abstract = {A function g(X, $\theta$) of data and parameters is said to be a pivot or a pivotal quantity if its distribution does not depend on the parameter. The primary example of a pivotal quantity is g(X, --) = X n - -- S n / - n (1.1) which has the distribution t(n - 1), when the data X 1 , . . ., X n are i. i. d. Normal(--, $\sigma$ 2) and X n = 1 n n i=1 X i (1.2a) S 2 n = 1 n - 1 n i=1 (X i - X n) 2 (1.2b) Pivotal quantities allow the construction of exact confidence intervals, mean-ing they have exactly the stated confidence level, as opposed to so-called " asymp-totic " or " large-sample " confidence intervals which only have approximately the stated confidence level and that only when the sample size is large. An exact confidence interval is valid for any sample size. An asymptotic confidence in-terval is valid only for sufficiently large sample size (and typically one does not know how large is large enough). Exact intervals are constructed as follows. -- Find a pivotal quantity g(X, $\theta$). -- Find upper and lower confidence limits on the pivotal quantity, that is, numbers c 1 and c 2 such that Pr{\{}c 1 {\textless} g(X, $\theta$) {\textless} c 2 {\}} = $\gamma$ (1.3) where $\gamma$ is the desired confidence coefficient. 1 -- Solve the inequalities: the confidence set (usually an interval) is {\{} $\theta$ - $\Theta$ : c 1 {\textless} g(X, $\theta$) {\textless} c 2 {\}} (1.4) The point is that the probability (1.3) does not depend on the parameter $\theta$ by definition of " pivotal quantity. " If g(X, $\theta$) were not pivotal, then the probability (1.3) would depend on the unknown true parameter value and could not be calculated. The constants c 1 and c 2 in (1.3) are called critical values. They are obtained from a table for the distribution of the pivotal quantity or from a computer program.},

abstract = {Some social institutions reveal participants' behavior in the aggregate, while concealing the identities of the participants. For example, individual church donations may be kept anonymous, while the total amount raised is publicized. This presents a puzzle in light of recent evidence that anonymity reduces contributions. We offer an explanation for this puzzle in the context of a model of costly signaling with two types of agents: conditionally cooperative (" good" ) and uncooperative (" bad" ). We consider costly participation in a community activity (e.g., tithing) as a signal of an individual's type. By signaling the presence of one more good type, this may lead other good types to contribute more in future, more important, collective goods problems (CGP's). Thus, if good types also value others' contributions more than bad types, good types gain more from sending the signal. But if those who do not signal face exclusion, the signal would need to be made very costly to dissuade bad types from signaling. In contrast, if the institution is anonymous, so that it reveals only the total number of signals, then while signals cannot be used to exclude bad types, even an inexpensive signal may succeed in revealing the total number of good types. This informationhelps good types maximize the conditional cooperation component of their utility in the CGP, and under specified conditions, can increase expected CGP contributions. We characterize conditions under which an anonymous signaling institution increases expected welfare. We provide examples of institutions that may yield such benefits, including religion, music and dance, voting, charitable donations, and military traditions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

A common finding is that potential donors give less when there is greater risk that their donation will have less impact. While this behavior could be fully rationalized by standard economic models, this paper shows that an additional mechanism is relevant: the use of risk as an excuse not to give. In a laboratory study, participants evaluate risky payoffs for themselves and risky payoffs for a charity. When their decisions do not involve tradeoffs between money for themselves and the charity, they respond very similarly to self risk and charity risk. By contrast, when their decisions force tradeoffs between money for themselves and the charity, participants act more averse to charity risk and less averse to self risk. These altered responses to risk bias participants towards choosing payoffs for themselves more often, consistent with excuse-driven responses to risk. Additional results support the existence of excuse-driven types.},

abstract = {Collective Action and Status


My dissertation research addressed a central puzzle of social science:
How is social order possible among individuals who are tempted to
behave selfishly? Why and when do individuals pursue social goals
rather than egoistic ones? My research develops and evaluates an
explanation of how the "free-rider problem" of collective action
can be overcome by individuals' desires for social status, and the
availability of increased status for those who contribute to public
goods.


In a series of laboratory experiments, I show that contributors to
collective action (a) enjoy improved status in the eyes of group
members, (b) have greater influence on subsequent group tasks, and
(c) benefit from "indirect reciprocity" in the form of gifts as well
as higher rates of cooperation. Results suggest that contributions
are a sign of generosity, rather than wealth or the ability to contribute
(as suggested by most "costly signaling" accounts), or a sign of
obligation to reciprocate (as suggested by exchange theory). A fourth
study investigated the group-level impact of status rewards for contributions,
indicating that they promote productivity, solidarity, and identification.},

abstract = {Examining myopic loss aversion in real financial markets has several merits: in repeated situations investors may learn from each other, aggregate market prices may eliminate individual violations of expected utility, and individuals may decide differently in real situations than in laboratories. We utilize a special feature at the Tel Aviv stock exchange (TASE): occasional shifts of securities from daily to weekly trading. If investors' decisions are influenced by trading frequency manipulation, then returns should be predictably affected. MLA results in a negative relation between risk aversion and the length of the evaluation period. Thus, the longer the evaluation period is, the lower the expected return is. This intuition also suggests reduced sensitivity to economic events in longer evaluation periods. We find strong support for MLA in the marketplace when testing expected return, as well as return sensitivity.},

In principle, the sampling design can be modified in later stages or replications to allow for more efficient estimation of causal effects. We consider the design of a two-stage experiment for estimating an average treatment effect when covariate information is available for experimental subjects. We use data from the first stage to choose a conditional treatment assignment rule for units in the second stage of the experiment. This amounts to choosing the propensity score, the conditional probability of treatment given covariates. We propose to select the propensity score to minimize the asymptotic variance bound for estimating the average treatment effect. Our procedure can be implemented simply using standard statistical software and has attractive large-sample properties.},

models with fixed effects in panel data. Up until now, no estimator
has been shown to be consistent as the cross section dimension increases
with the time dimension fixed. Trimmed least absolute deviations
(LAD) and trimmed least squares estimators are proposed for the case
where the panel is of length two, and it is proven that they are
consistent and asymptotically normal under suitable regularity conditions.
It is not necessary to maintain parametric assumptions on the error
terms to obtain this result. Because three of the four estimators
are defined as minimizers of nondifferentiable functions, traditional
methods cannot be used to establish asymptotic normality. Instead,
the approach of Pakes and Pollard (1989) is used. A small scale Monte
Carlo study demonstrates that these estimators can perform well in
small samples. Despite their nonlinear nature, the estimators are
easy to calculate in practice, as are consistent estimators of their
asymptotic variances. Generalization of the estimators to panels
of arbitrary length is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Connecting with others increases happiness, but strangers in close proximity routinely ignore each other. Why? Two reasons seem likely: Either solitude is a more positive experience than interacting with strangers, or people misunderstand the consequences of distant social connections. To examine the experience of connecting to strangers, we instructed commuters on trains and buses to connect with a stranger near them, to remain disconnected, or to commute as normal (Experiments 1a and 2a). In both contexts, participants reported a more positive (and no less productive) experience when they connected than when they did not. Separate participants in each context, however, expected precisely the opposite outcome, predicting a more positive experience in solitude (Experiments 1b and 2b). This mistaken preference for solitude stems partly from underestimating others' interest in connecting (Experiments 3a and 3b), which in turn keeps people from learning the actual consequences of social interaction (Experiments 4a and 4b). The pleasure of connection seems contagious: In a laboratory waiting room, participants who were talked to had equally positive experiences as those instructed to talk (Experiment 5). Human beings are social animals. Those who misunderstand the consequences of social interactions may not, in at least some contexts, be social enough for their own well-being.

The ascendancy of the human capital approach can be viewed as a reaction of economists to this non-economic, though certainly not irrelevant, tradition. In stressing the role played by individual and family optimizing decisions in human capital investments, important aspects of income determination are brought back within the mainstream of economic theory and within the power of its analytical and econometric tools. Human capital is not the only element of choice in the analysis of income distribution . Nevertheless, it appears that the subject of human capital investments lends itself to a more systematic and comprehensive analysis of wage differentials, than each of the other factors. The following is a description of research in the distribution of labor incomes in which human capital theory serves as an organizing principle. It is, in part, a sequel to my 1970 survey and, in part, a report of ongoing research of my own and of others.},

Research on excessive discounting of the future suggests that removing the lure of immediate rewards by precommitting to decisions or elaborating the value of future rewards both can make decisions more future oriented. The authors explore a third and complementary route, one that deals not with present and future rewards but with present and future selves. In line with research that shows that people may fail, because of a lack of belief or imagination, to identify with their future selves, the authors propose that allowing people to interact with age-progressed renderings of themselves will cause them to allocate more resources to the future. In four studies, participants interacted with realistic computer renderings of their future selves using immersive virtual reality hardware and interactive decision aids. In all cases, those who interacted with their virtual future selves exhibited an increased tendency to accept later monetary rewards over immediate ones.

abstract = {We describe the -evaluability bias-: the tendency to weight the importance of an attribute in proportion to its ease of evaluation. We propose that the evaluability bias influences decision making in the context of charitable giving: people tend to have a strong preference for charities with low overhead ratios (lower administrative expenses) but not for charities with high cost-effectiveness (greater number of saved lives per dollar), because the former attribute is easier to evaluate than the latter. In line with this hypothesis, we report the results of four studies showing that, when presented with a single charity, people are willing to donate more to a charity with low overhead ratio, regardless of cost-effectiveness. However, when people are presented with two charities simultaneously-thereby enabling comparative evaluation-they base their donation behavior on cost-effectiveness (Study 1). This suggests that people primarily value cost-effectiveness but manifest the evaluability bias in cases where they find it difficult to evaluate. However, people seem also to value a low overhead ratio for its own sake (Study 2). The evaluability bias effect applies to charities of different domains (Study 3). We also show that overhead ratio is easier to evaluate when its presentation format is a ratio, suggesting an inherent reference point that allows meaningful interpretation (Study 4).},

start by defining briefly Fair Trade, its different dimensions (including
the -fair- quality of the

between the pioneer

-Alternative Trading Organizations- and the second-mover companies.
Then, we recall the

theoretical emergence factors for each type of organization (nonprofit,
co-operative and for-

profit) and apply these emergence factors to the context of Fair Trade.
This analysis allows us

to capture the specificities of each type of operator with regard
to Fair Trade and, thus, to have

a better understanding of the competition dynamics in the sector.
The latter analysis includes

elements on ethical imitation, consumers' behaviors, effects on welfare
and the role of the

abstract = {Abstract:

A persistent puzzle in the social and biological sciences is the existence
of prosocial behavior, actions that benefit others, often at a cost
to oneself. Recent theoretical models and empirical studies of indirect
reciprocity show that actors behave prosocially in order to develop
an altruistic reputation and receive future benefits from third parties.
Accordingly, individuals should stop investing in reputations via
prosocial behavior when a future benefit (via indirect reciprocity)
is unlikely. The conclusion that the absence of reputational incentives
necessarily leads to egoistic behavior contrasts sharply with models
of heterogeneous social preferences. Such models demonstrate the
theoretical plausibility of populations composed of egoists and altruists.
Results of Study One show that actors classified a priori as egoists
respond strategically to reputational incentives, whereas those classified
a priori as altruists are less affected by these incentives. Egoists
act prosocially when reputational incentives are at stake but not
when opportunities for indirect reciprocity are absent, while altruists
tend to act prosocially regardless of whether reputational incentives
are present. These results suggest that altruistic behavior can result
from non-strategic altruism or reputation-building egoism. Study
Two replicates these results and explores indirect reciprocation
of others' prosocial acts. We found that altruists indirectly reciprocate
at higher levels than egoists, and individuals tend to discount others'
prosocial behaviors when they occur in the presence of reputational
incentives. As a result, public prosocial behaviors are indirectly
reciprocated less than private prosocial behaviors. In line with
our argument that altruists pay less attention to reputational incentives,
egoists showed a greater tendency than altruists to discount others'
public prosocial behaviors. The results support the growing focus
on heterogeneity of individuals' social preferences in models of
altruism and indirect reciprocity},

abstract = {Alumni giving is correlated with institutional characteristics, such
as quality and development efforts, and student characteristics,
such as quality and wealth. Empirical analysis is complicated by
the expected correlation between institutional quality and student
wealth, and the possible endogeneity between institutional expenditures
on education (one common measure of quality) and the level of alumni
support the institution receives. This paper uses a two-stage least
squares approach with data on quality and variables correlated with
student wealth to address these issues. Quality variables are found
to have a positive impact on the average alumni gift, with that impact
most significant for private universities and liberal arts colleges.
Wealth variables also have a positive impact on the average gift,
with the estimated coefficients most significant for public universities.
Development effort is very important in determining the level of
giving for all three types of institutions.},

abstract = {Why do people engage in charitable giving? Certainly there are many reasons for this. Social norms, social perceptions, religious convictions, and other considerations may all play a role. However, beyond all those reasons, the wish to help other people, particularly when those people are in need of external help, is the core motivation for charitable giving and helping behavior. Thus, in order to better understand the psychological motivation of charitable giving, it is important to explore the factors that may increase or decrease the fundamental wish to extend help. One of the main factors that affects the wish to aid is the characteristics of the target-the recipient of the help. Why do some targets elicit outpourings of sympathy and aid, while other targets do not? In this chapter we review experimental and theoretical work on the effect of victims identifiability on charitable giving. We integrate recent findings, concentrating on the psychological processes underlying the effect and its boundary conditions.},

image motivation. By definition, image depends on one{\^{A}}'s behavior
being visible to other people. Using this unique property we show
that image is indeed an important part of the motivation to behave
prosocially. Moreover, we show that extrinsic incentives interact
with image motivation and are therefore less effective in public
than in private. Together, these results imply that image motivation
is crowded out by monetary incentives; this means that monetary incentives
are more likely to be counterproductive for public prosocial activities
than for private ones. JEL},

However, a few jurisdictions have shifted towards defined contribution (DC) plans as their primary savings plan, and fiscal pressures are likely to generate more movement in this direction. Holding fixed a public employee-{\"{A}}{\`{o}}s work and salary history, we show that DB retirement income replacement ratios vary greatly across jurisdictions. This creates large variation in workers-{\"{A}}{\`{o}} need to save for retirement in other accounts. There is also substantial heterogeneity across jurisdictions in the savings generated in primary DC plans because of differences in the level of mandatory employer and employee contributions. One notable difference between public and private sector DC plans is that public sector primary DC plans are characterized by required employee or employer contributions (or both), whereas private sector plans largely feature voluntary employee contributions that are supplemented by an employer match. We conclude by applying lessons from savings behavior in private sector savings plans to the design of public sector plans.},

While that motive is straightforward, its logical implications are significantly different from other models of philanthropy. For example, the contributions of other donors can reduce an impact philanthropist's charitable fulfillment. As a result, cooperation among impact philanthropists can reduce aggregate giving. In addition, impact philanthropy can lead to a codependent relationship between givers and receivers in which both benefit from the other. Finally, the model suggests a conflict between charitable organizations and its donors concerning the allocation of charitable gifts. In particular, a charitable organization prefers to spread a donor's contribution across many goods, whereas a donor prefers to target his or her contribution at a specific good.},

These questions are assessed among married workers using an identical survey distributed to Dutch and American workers in 2007. Despite marked differences in expected pension replacement rates - where the Dutch replacement rates are systematically higher than the American rates - the perceived savings adequacy is more or less the same across Dutch and American workers. In both countries, about half of the respondents were confident they had amassed sufficient retirement savings. Individuals' perceived savings adequacy was found to be influenced by three groups of factors : trust in pension institutions (pension funds, banks, insurance companies and governments), social forces and psychological dispositions. This study shows that differences in the dispositions of workers (with respect to future orientation and financial planning) played a far larger role in explaining differences in perceptions of savings adequacy in the United States than in The Netherlands. Dutch workers rely and trust their pension fund and seem to leave thinking about and planning for retirement to its managers. KEY},

success depends on a person's

accessible goal. We propose that positive mood signals a person to
adopt an accessible goal, whereas

negative mood signals a person to reject an accessible goal; therefore,
if a self-improvement goal is

accessible, happy (vs. neutral or unhappy) people perform better on
self-control tasks that further that

goal. Conversely, if a mood management goal is accessible, happy people
abstain from self-control tasks

because the tasks are incompatible with this goal. This pattern receives
consistent support across several

self-control tasks, including donating to charity, demonstrating physical
endurance, seeking negative

feedback, and completing tests.

Policy decisions, in turn, affect asset values, hence forward looking traders may have incentives to withhold information.   I derive  a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of fully revealing equilibria in competitive financial markets, which identifies all situations where learning from prices for policy purposes works, and where it does not. Full revelation may be impossible because the pricing problem is a self-defeating prophecy. Using the result, I demonstrate that some corporate prediction markets are ill-designed and punish traders for revealing their information, and show how to fix it. I also discuss the possibility of using market information for banking supervision and central banking, and the general problem of asset design.},

abstract = {The interpretation of instrumental variables (IV) estimates as local average treatment effects (LATE) of instrument-induced shifts in treatment raises concerns about their external validity and policy relevance. We examine how to move beyond LATE in situations where the instrument is discrete, as it often is in applied research. Discrete instruments do not give sufficient support to identify the full range of marginal treatment effects (MTE) in the usual local instrumental variable approach. We show how an alternative estimation approach allows identification of richer specifications of the MTE when the instrument is discrete. One result is that the alternative approach identifies a linear MTE model even with a single binary instrument. Although restrictive, the linear MTE model nests the standard IV estimator: The model gives the exact same estimate of LATE while at the same time providing a simple test for its external validity and a linear extrapolation. Another result is that the alternative approach allows identification of a general MTE model under the auxiliary assumption of additive separability between observed and unobserved heterogeneity in treatment effects. We apply these identification results to empirically assess the interaction between the quantity and quality of children. Motivated by the seminal quantity-quality model of fertility, a large and growing body of empirical research has used binary instruments to estimate LATEs of family size on child outcomes. We show that the effects of family size are both more varied and more extensive than what the LATEs suggest. Our MTE estimates reveal that the family size effects vary in magnitude and even sign, and that families act as if they possess some knowledge of the idiosyncratic effects in the fertility decision.},

Investment preferences of survey respondents, estimated using the scale-adjusted version of a latent class choice model, also change during the crisis. We identify age and income as important determinants of preference classes in both surveys and age is also identified as a key determinant of variability (scale). Young and low income individuals make choices that are more consistent with standard mean-variance analysis, but older and higher income individuals react positively to both higher returns and increasing risk in returns.

At Anon U, volunteers use lists provided by the Development Office to telephone classmates and solicit them for donations. The names on these lists are always in alphabetical order. The volunteers who do the soliciting often run out of time before they reach the end of their lists. These observations suggest a simple strategy for testing whether personal solicitation matters, viz., examine whether alumni with names toward the end of the alphabet are less likely to give than alumni with names toward the beginning, ceteris paribus. If so, then a marginal personal solicitation matters. Our main finding is that the location in the alphabet - and hence, a marginal personal solicitation - has a strong effect on the probability of making a gift. A rough estimate of the elasticity of the probability of giving with respect to the probability of receiving a personal solicitation is 0.15. However, there is no statistically discernible effect on the amount given, conditional on donating. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Our estimates demonstrate a strong life-cycle bias, often exceeding the bias from assuming that schooling is exogenous.

The study uses separate measurements of competence at the start and at the end of education. Moreover, we use a direct measurement of competence development during medical education. This enables us to disentangle the effects of the suggested mechanisms. The results suggest that after graduation human capital factors do not explain subsequent differences in labour market outcomes. The medical degree seems a sufficient signal of screening device as such. However, selection processes during education take place on human capital acquired before and during medical education.},

that total search effort and instability of the outcome vary in the

abstract = {Two main reasons why people donate to charity are that they have been asked and asked by someone they care about. One would therefore expect that charitable organizations could benefit from peer-to-peer fundraising if they were able to persuade donors to do so for them. However, little is known on the costs and benefits of asking donors to fundraise. We investigate this by implementing a field experiment embedded in an online giving organization's web page. In our experiment, donors who have completed an online transaction were randomly asked to share having donated by posting on their Facebook (FB) wall or by sending a private message to a friend on FB. To further explore the impact of incentives on the willingness to fundraise, donors were also assigned to one of three treatments in which the organization added either {\$}0, {\$}1 or {\$}5 in the donor's name in exchange for sharing the information. We have several findings: (1) Donors respond to incentives: larger add-on donations increase the willingness to post having made a donation. (2) Nuisance costs may be important: willingness to post is over two times higher among those already logged into FB. (3) The type of ask matters: willingness to post via one's wall or via a private message is different. (4) There are benefits to incentivizing peer-to-peer fundraising in increased new donations.},

Based on this hypothesis, the present study empirically examines the effect of university location choice on earnings in Finland, focusing on the following question: To what extent does the choice of university location explain the observed positive early-career earnings premium for students graduating from the Helsinki metropolitan area rather than from one of the nine other university cities? The results suggest that no positive average earnings premium exists for metro area graduates after differences in students' pre-university characteristics are taken into account. However, the metro area university premium is found to be, to some extent, heterogeneous across fields and regional labour markets. The findings also indicate the importance of accounting for the selective nature of individuals' migration behaviour when conditioning on post-university region in the estimation of university location effects.},

abstract = {Many applied settings in empirical economics involve simultaneous estimation of a large number of parameters. In particular, applied economists are often interested in estimating the effects of many-valued treatments (like teacher effects or location effects), treatment effects for many groups, and prediction models with many regressors. In these settings, machine learning methods that combine regularized estimation and data-driven choices of regularization parameters are useful to avoid over-fitting. In this article, we analyze the performance of a class of machine learning estimators that includes ridge, lasso and pretest in contexts that require simultaneous estimation of many parameters. Our analysis aims to provide guidance to applied researchers on (i) the choice between regularized estimators in practice and (ii) data-driven selection of regularization parameters. To address (i), we characterize the risk (mean squared error) of regularized estimators and derive their relative performance as a function of simple features of the data generating process. To address (ii), we show that data-driven choices of regularization parameters, based on Stein's unbiased risk estimate or on cross-validation, yield estimators with risk uniformly close to the risk attained under the optimal (unfeasible) choice of regularization parameters. We use data from recent examples in the empirical economics literature to illustrate the practical applicability of our results.},

good is analyzed in a game in which people have preferences for private

feels disapproval, whereas a contributor feels approval if he believes

stable states: one in which everybody is a contributor, and one in

abstract = {A fast-growing market for meta-analytic software is R. Despite the pervasive availability of meta-analytic R packages, only a small number of publications have examined the abilities of these packages (Chen {\&} Pence, 2013; Neupane, Richer, Bonner, Kibret, {\&} Beyene, 2014), and no review to date has comprehensively cataloged each package. As such, the purpose of this project is to delineate the scope and breadth of meta-analytic R packages in order to: a) inform the meta-analytic field of the availability of these packages, b) explore the packages' power and applicability, c) elucidate future areas of greater package need. To answer these questions, we conducted a systematic review of meta-analytic R packages using various aggregators (e.g., CRAN website, Revolution Analytics, Crantastic). The search process yielded 136 potential packages of which 54 provided unique contributions (See online appendix). We coded specific capabilities of each package using a pre-defined codebook (See online appendix). Although the coding process is still ongoing, preliminary results indicated a plethora of traditional functionality (e.g., weighted average calculations, moderator analyses), but few packages for the review stage (i.e., screening or coding) or advanced analyses (i.e., multilevel modeling, graphics). The final results will be available prior to the June conference.},

options represented as gambles with monetary consequences. In Exp
1 with 67 undergraduates (aged 18-26 yrs), 25 gambles were presented
to Ss: In Exp 2, with 47 undergraduates (aged 18-27 yrs), were presented
45 gambles to Ss. Results from the 2 experiments show that the emotional
reaction to a monetary outcome is not a simple function of the utility
of that outcome. Emotional responses also depend on probabilities
and unobtained outcomes. Unexpected outcomes have greater emotional
impact than expected outcomes. Furthermore, any given outcome is
less pleasant if an unobtained outcome is better. The authors propose
an account of emotional experiences associated with outcomes of decisions
called decision affect theory. Decision affect theory incorporates
utilities, expectations, and counterfactual comparisons into hedonic
responses. Finally, the authors show that choices between risky options
can be described as the maximization of expected emotional experiences,
as predicted by decision affect theory. (PsycINFO Database Record

Estimating the cost or benefit of military service is complicated by the complex selection that determines who eventually serves in the military: On the one hand, potential conscripts have to pass medical and psychological examinations before entering the military, and on the other hand numerous (temporary) exemptions exist that can be manipulated by young men to avoid military service. We use substantial, policy-induced variation in aggregate military enrollment rates to deal with these selection issues. We find that approximately 10 years after serving in the military former conscripts have earnings that are on average 5{\%} lower than the earnings of members of their birth cohort who did not serve in the military. These findings are shown to be robust against a variety of specifications.},

abstract = {sWhile affluent consumers in rich

countries pay several dollars for a cup of

latte at the local Starbucks, millions of

small-scale coffee farmers are struggling

as coffee bean prices have plummeted to

historic lows. The juxtaposition of the

designer coffee boom and rock-bottom

raw material prices strikes market critics

as compelling evidence of unfairness and

exploitation. They blame multinational

coffee roasters and retailers for profiting

at poor farmers' expense, and they propose

a number of schemes-including

-fair trade- coffee, the use of new quality

standards to restrict imports, and the

return to political management of coffee

exports-to help coffee farmers by propping

up coffee bean prices.

The coffee market is clearly far from

the textbook model of frictionless efficiency.

Its adjustment of supply and

demand is subject to long lags and overshooting.

Nevertheless, the story of the

current coffee glut is at bottom a story of

falling costs and productivity improvements

on both the supply and the

demand sides. In particular, prices have

fallen so low primarily because of dramatically

expanded production by low-cost

suppliers in Brazil and Vietnam. And

those low prices are a signal to high-cost

producers-for example, in Central

America-to supply a higher-value product

or exit the market.

However well-intentioned, interventionist

schemes to lift prices above market

levels ignore those market realities.

Accordingly, they are doomed to end in

failure-or to offer cures that are worse

than the disease. There are constructive

measures that can help to ease the plight

of struggling coffee farmers, but they consist

of efforts to improve the market's performance

-not block it or demonize it.},

community, this paper investigates the impact of transaction costs
on the institutional structure of exchange. Fish markets in this
region are connected and organized into a hierarchical network. This
structure of fish markets dramatically reduces the cost for geographically
distanced fishermen and consumers to execute trades. However, the
provision of the market itself requires entrepreneurial efforts.
In this study, the market is conceptualized as a continuum of middlemen,
whose entrepreneurial efforts of buying and selling make the market
work. When the middleman makes profits, the market is at work. Otherwise,
the market fails to emerge. Comparing the different ways of organizing
fish transportation at two distinct villages, this paper shows that
the choice of the market or the firm to organize fish transportation
is determined by the cost of putting the market to work.},

and producers in expanding North/South Fair Trade coffee networks.
I develop a commodity network framework that builds on the commodity
chain tradition, integrating insights from cultural studies, actor-network
theory, and conventions approaches. This framework illuminates how
material and ideological relations are negotiated across production
and consumption arenas. In the case of Fair Trade, progressive ideas
and practices related to trust, equality, and global responsibility
are intertwined with traditional commercial and industrial conventions.
As I demonstrate, the negotiation of these divergent conventions
shortens the social distance between Fair Trade coffee consumers
and producers. I conclude that by re-linking consumers and producers,
commodity network analysis provides a robust entr{\'{e}} for academic inquiry
and engagement in alternative food politics.},

Our standard for assessing optimality comes from a life-cycle model that incorporates uncertain lifetimes, uninsurable earnings and medical expenses, progressive taxation, government transfers, and pension and social security benefit functions derived from rich household data. We solve every household's decision problem from death to starting age and then use the decision rules in conjunction with earnings histories to make predictions about wealth in 1992. Ours is the first study to compare, household by household, wealth predictions that arise from a life-cycle model that incorporates earnings histories for a nationally representative sample. The results, based on data from the Health and Retirement Study, are striking we find that the model is capable of accounting for more than 80 percent of the 1992 cross-sectional variation in wealth. Fewer than 20 percent of households have less wealth than their optimal targets, and the wealth deficit of those who are undersaving is generally small.},

gave to causes that explained how these funds are used to make a

asked to reflect upon a time they spent money on themselves or on
others in a way that either had a positive impact or had no impact.
Participants who recalled a time they spent on others that had a
positive impact were happiest. Together, these results suggest that
highlighting the impact of prosocial spending can increase the emotional

I investigate this question using a novel data set from Charity Navigator which provides quality ratings for 5400 charities. Since Charity Navigator prominently displays a charity------{\O}s star rating which is assigned based on its overall rating, one can identify the causal impact of a one star increase in ratings on charitable contributions with a regression discontinuity framework that exploits the threshold values of the overall ratings. I find that in general, the third party ratings have a minor and often insignificant impact on charitable contributions received by charities. However, for relatively smaller and unknown charities, a higher rating leads to an increase in charitable contributions received. In particular, for these charities, I find that a one star increase in ratings is associated with a 19.5 percent increase in the amount of charitable contributions received. This result is robust under alternative model specifications and highlights the role of the third party ratings in not-for-profit markets.},

Based on principles of comparative advantage, scholars commonly presume that positive selection is at work, that is, individuals who are most likely to select into college also benefit most from college. Net of observed economic and noneconomic factors influencing college attendance, we conjecture that individuals who are least likely to obtain a college education benefit the most from college. We call this theory the negative selection hypothesis. To adjudicate between the two hypotheses, we study the effects of completing college on earnings by propensity score strata using an innovative hierarchical linear model with data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. For both cohorts, for both men and women, and for every observed stage of the life course, we find evidence suggesting negative selection. Results from auxiliary analyses lend further support to the negative selection hypothesis.},

each player -selects- an emotional state which determines the player's

the concept behind the definition of mental equilibrium and show

a large contribution by a single wealthy donor? This paper explores
the possibility that such "leadership giving" provides a signal to
all other givers that the charity is of high quality. The dilemma
is that if the lead giver can deceive others to believe the charity
is of higher quality than it truly is, then these followers will
make larger contributions, which will benefit the leader. Hence,
the leader must give an unusually large amount to convey a credible
signal of the quality. This sets up a war-of-attrition game for who
will pay the cost to signal the quality. Since the wealthy have the
lowest opportunity cost of providing the signal, they, in equilibrium,
move first to provide the signal of quality with exceptionally large

We approached about 4500 households, each participating in an all-pay auction, a lottery, a non-anonymous voluntary contribution mechanism (VCM), or an anonymous VCM. In contrast to the VCMs, households in the all-pay auction and the lottery competed for a prize. Although the all-pay auction is the superior fundraising mechanism both in theory and in the laboratory, it did not raise the highest revenue per household in the field and even raised significantly less than the anonymous VCM. Our experiment reveals that this can be attributed to substantially lower participation in the all-pay auction than in the other mechanisms while the average donation for those who contribute is only slightly (and statistically insignificantly) higher. We explore various explanations for this lower participation and favor one that argues that competition in the all-pay mechanism crowds out intrinsic motivations to contribute.},

We provide a framework for formally "declaring" the analytically relevant features of a research design in a demonstrably complete manner, with applications to qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research.

Declaration of these features in code provides sufficient information for researchers and readers to use Monte Carlo techniques to diagnose properties such as power, bias, accuracy of qualitative causal inferences, and other "diag-nosands." Ex ante declarations can be used to improve designs and facilitate preregistration, analysis, and reconciliation of intended and actual analyses. Ex post declarations are useful for describing, sharing, reanalyzing, and critiquing existing designs.

to informational conditions,

but it is unclear why. I conceptually and experimentally distinguish
between three leading

explanations, all based upon beliefs about the giver, which previous
work has not adequately

distinguished. 1) Social-signaling holds that a person wants others
to think of her as fair-

minded, 2) self-signaling says she would like to think of herself
that way, and 3) beliefs-based

altruism says that she cares about how her action makes another person
feel. I present a model

in which the decision-maker signals her preferences to an observer,
which can correspond to each

of these motivations. I experimentally test these interpretations
using the model's predictions

about a dictator game in which the outcome may be determined either
by the dictator's choice

or by chance. Limiting the recipient's ability to infer the dictator's
choice lowers the frequency

of giving, which is evidence of either social-signaling or beliefs-based
altruism. However, I

find little willingness to pay to in uence a recipient's beliefs about
how he was treated by a

third-party dictator, providing little support for belief-based altruism,
and revealing partial

information about the dictator's identity, while holding constant
the recipient's information

about his treatment, increases the frequency and amount of giving,
suggesting social-signaling.

Finally, lowering the expected cost of the decision to give by decreasing
the likelihood that it

will be implemented has little effect on dictator giving when the
beliefs of the recipient are

held constant, offering little support for self-signaling. This suggests
that the act of giving is

largely tied to what it says to others about the giver, as opposed
to the self, or how it makes

the recipient feel.},

@article{Andreoni2004a,
abstract = {Laboratory researchers in economics assiduously protect the confidentiality
of subjects. Why? Presumably because they fear that the social consequences
of identifying subjects and their choices would significantly alter
the economic incentives of the game. But these may be the same social
effects that institutions, like charitable fund-raising, are manipulating
to help overcome free riding and to promote economic efficiency.
We present an experiment that unmasks subjects in a systematic and
controlled way. We show that, as intuition suggests, identifying
subjects has significant effects. Surprisingly, we found that two
supplemental conditions meant to mimic common fund-raising practices
actually had the most dramatic influences on behavior.


6. Conclusion


This paper set out to understand whether removing confidentiality
affects giving in a series of public goods experiments. We systematically
alter the identification of subjects and information on their contributions.
By unmasking subjects, we allow for various social effects, like
pride, shame, social comparison and prestige, to work. If identity
and information matter, this raises the natural question: have fund-raising
institutions been tailored to take advantage of these effects? To
get a glimpse into fund-raising strategies, we also conducted two
additional treatments. The first allows subjects the option of giving
anonymously. The second reports contributions in categories. This
allows us to observe whether these particular fund-raising practices
may have special merit, and if they may be worth studying in more
detail.


We found, first, that identity and information can matter. Knowing
only the distribution of contributions, but not the identity of the
givers, has no discernible effect. Knowing only the identity but
not the individual contributions has a modest effect of increasing
donations. However, knowing both who is in your group and what each
is choosing can significantly increase giving. Identification tends
to decrease free riding, and the combination of information and identification
tends to increase contributions.


Looking more deeply, we discovered that some people consistently set
a -good example' by contributing large amounts in the first period.
We found that the announcement structure has an important effect
on the number of these leaders and their ability to lead. Surprisingly,
leaders emerge most strongly when they can voluntarily report their
contribution to the rest of the group. Moreover, as social comparison
suggests, their role in the group is important as they appear to
increase the contribution levels of others. Along with the leaders,
we also uncovered laggards who consistently give small amounts in
the first period. Laggards, we found, are cowardly. They emerge when
information on actions and actors is noisy, and they cannot be easily
identified. Even more insidious is that their presence appears to
decrease the contributions of others. It seems the best way to deal
with laggards is to make their actions and identities known.


Second, and perhaps surprisingly, we found that two popular fund-raising
practices had significant impacts on behavior. For the option to
remain anonymous we found that, while few chose to do so, having
the option to contribute anonymously increased contributions to their
highest level and produced the most leaders. That is, giving people
the option to report their contributions results in more giving than
required reporting. It would appear that something about empowering
people with the choice to announce their contributions-even though
it is a -false' choice that no one would reject-might actually focus
them more on being leaders and example setters. This suggests that
indeed charities may be taking advantage of subtle behavioral effects
in designing this feature of the giving institution.


Categories also have the potential to affect contributions by significantly
shifting the distribution of contributions. This confirms [Harbaugh,
1998b] research, which incorporates a prestige motive to giving.
People tend to contribute at the lower end of the contribution category,
and some people give more to be in the higher category. Our results
suggest that carefully constructing the reporting categories has
the potential to significantly increase contributions.


The research we presented here suggests a broad set of new questions
for economic researchers, both theorists and experimenters. The effects
that economists factor out of their experiments and, to a large extent,
out of theoretical models may be the very effects that fund-raising
institutions may be using to help overcome free riding and promote
efficiency. This suggests that there may be much to be gained by
shifting our research toward understanding individual preferences,
social effects, and the institutions designed to take advantage of
them. Indeed, this research could be seen as a first step at collecting
the kind of information that may be useful to inform a theoretical
model of fund-raising practices. s},

This is despite the fact that selective institutions would often cost them less, owing to generous financial aid, than the resource-poor two-year and non-selective four-year institutions to which they actually apply. Moreover, high-achieving, low-income students who do apply to selective institutions are admitted and graduate at high rates. We demonstrate that these low-income students' application behavior differs greatly from that of their high-income counterparts who have similar achievement. The latter group generally follows the advice to apply to a few "par" colleges, a few "reach" colleges, and a couple of "safety" schools. We separate the low-income, high-achieving students into those whose application behavior is similar to that of their high-income counterparts ("achievement-typical" behavior) and those whose apply to no selective institutions ("income-typical" behavior). We show that income-typical students do not come from families or neighborhoods that are more disadvantaged than those of achievement-typical students. However, in contrast to the achievement-typical students, the income-typical students come from districts too small to support selective public high schools, are not in a critical mass of fellow high achievers, and are unlikely to encounter a teacher or schoolmate from an older cohort who attended a selective college. We demonstrate that widely-used policies-college admissions staff recruiting, college campus visits, college access programs-are likely to be ineffective with income-typical students, and we suggest policies that will be effective must depend less on geographic concentration of high achievers.},

lead to increased helpfulness. In an expanded analysis of the published
literature, we examined six distinct views about this relation: the
focus of attention, objective self-awareness, separate process, social
outlook, mood maintenance, and concomitance hypotheses. For each
of 61 positive affect conditions in which it was possible to generate
an effect-size estimate corresponding to the relative degree of helpfulness
exhibited by positive mood subjects (compared with neutral affect
subjects), judges assessed the contextual levels of variables relevant
to each of the six hypotheses by reading the Method section of each
article. Higher-order partial correlation coefficients were then
calculated to isolate the independent contribution of each of the
theoretically relevant variables to the variation among the 61 effect
sizes. The results support the focus of attention, separate process,
social outlook, and mood maintenance hypotheses, and partially support
the objective self-awareness and concomitance hypotheses. (PsycINFO

When this is not the case, commodity taxation is a tool that allows the government to expand its taxation power and is therefore desirable. This can happen either when the government uses social weights correlated with consumption patterns even conditioning on income or when patterns of consumption are related to intrinsic earning power or leisure choices. In that latter case, the desirability of commodity taxation hinges not on whether the commodity is consumed disproportionately by high earners but rather on whether individual demand for that good is less elastic than the cross-sectional demand pattern. ...},

My dissertation research addressed a central puzzle of social science:
How is social order possible among individuals who are tempted to
behave selfishly? Why and when do individuals pursue social goals
rather than egoistic ones? My research develops and evaluates an
explanation of how the "free-rider problem" of collective action
can be overcome by individuals' desires for social status, and the
availability of increased status for those who contribute to public
goods.


In a series of laboratory experiments, I show that contributors to
collective action (a) enjoy improved status in the eyes of group
members, (b) have greater influence on subsequent group tasks, and
(c) benefit from "indirect reciprocity" in the form of gifts as well
as higher rates of cooperation. Results suggest that contributions
are a sign of generosity, rather than wealth or the ability to contribute
(as suggested by most "costly signaling" accounts), or a sign of
obligation to reciprocate (as suggested by exchange theory). A fourth
study investigated the group-level impact of status rewards for contributions,
indicating that they promote productivity, solidarity, and identification.},

@article{Sarvary1997a,
abstract = {Selling information that is later used in decision making constitutes
an increasingly important business in modern economies (Jensen 1991).
Information is sold under a large variety of forms: industry reports,
consulting services, database access, and/or professional opinions
given by medical, engineering, accounting/financial, and legal professionals,
among others. This paper is the first attempt in marketing to study
competition in the rapidly emerging information sector. Specifically,
we are interested in answering the following questions: (1) Is competition
fundamentally different when competing firms sell information rather
than traditional goods and services, and-if yes-why? (2) What are
the implications of such differences for decision makers (marketers
and regulators)? (3) Can we explain some of the observed marketing
strategies in the information industry? As such, the audience of
the paper includes academics as well as professionals who are interested
in understanding what is specific about competition in information
markets. Familiarity with the practical implications of such differences
and understanding of the mechanisms that drive them is essential
for those who are faced with the problem of marketing information.
To answer the above research questions we build a simple game-theoretic
model that consists of two firms selling information to a population
of consumers who are heterogeneous in their willingness to pay for
the quality of information. The most important features of the model
are the following. Information products sold by the two firms are
modeled as random draws from two normal distributions having equal
mean. The variances of these distributions and their correlatedness
constitute the product-attribute space, which is assumed to be common
knowledge. Consumers are interested in assessing the mean of the
distributions and to do so they can buy the sample from any of the
firms or they can buy both samples and combine them to obtain a more
accurate estimate. Quality of information is linked to the accuracy
of consumers' estimate of the mean which in turn is influenced by
the accuracy of each sample as well as by their correlatedness. Consumers'
utility depends on the quality of information they purchased, on
their inherent utility for quality (taste), and on the total price
they paid to acquire information. Knowing consumer preferences, firms
simultaneously price their information products. The main finding
of the paper is that information markets face unique competitive
structures. In particular, the qualitative nature of competition
changes depending on basic product characteristics. While traditional
products and services compete either as substitutes or as complements
in the relevant product-attribute space, information may be one or
the other, depending on its position within the same product-attribute
space. Said differently, the nature of competition changes qualitatively
with a continuous change in basic product-attribute levels. The intuition
behind this finding is the following. When purchasing information,
consumers facing important decisions may find it beneficial to purchase
from several information sellers. This is more likely to happen when
the reliability of information is low and the sources of information
are independent. Under such conditions information products tend
to be complements and, as a result, competition between sellers is
relatively mild. In the opposite case, when information is reliable
and/or sellers' sources are highly correlated, consumers are satisfied
after consulting a single source. In this case, information products
are substitutes and sellers tend to undercut one another's prices
to induce consumers to choose their brand. Understanding this discontinuity
in competitive structures has important implications for decision
makers as very different strategies are optimal under different product
characteristics. Under substitution, traditional strategies to avoid
competition (e.g., differentiation) are recommended. When the competing
products' reliability is generally low (they are complements) firms
are better off accommodating competition. In fact, we find that a
firm may benefit from "inviting" a competitor. Finally, our findings
are also important for regulators of information markets. As the
literature on complementarity suggests, price fixing agreements between
firms offering complementary products may benefit firms as well as
consumers.},

This may transform a disappointing dataset into a publishable study, but it does so at the cost of increasing the Type I error rate. How big of a problem is this, and what can we do about it? To answer the first question, we estimate the Type I error inflation based on the initial sample size, the number of participants used to augment the dataset, the critical value for determining significance (typically .05), and the maximum p value within the initial sample such that the dataset would be augmented. With one round of augmentation, Type I error inflation maximizes at .0975 with typical values from .0564 to .0883. To answer the second question, we review methods of adjusting the critical value to allow augmentation while maintaining p {\textless} .05, but we note that such methods must be applied a priori. For the common occurrence of post-hoc dataset augmentation, we develop a new statistic, paugmented , that represents the magnitude of the resulting Type I error inflation. We argue that the disclosure of post-hoc dataset augmentation via paugmented elevates such augmentation from a questionable research practice to an ethical research decision.},

abstract = {Consumers have shown a willingness to pay a premium for products labeled as "FT" and a preference for retailers that are seen to be more generous to their suppliers/employees. A FT product is essentially a bundle of a base product and a donation to the supplier (e.g., a coffee farmer). An altruistic rational consumer will only choose this bundle if doing so is less expensive than buying the base product and making a direct donation. For FT to be sustainable either in a competitive equilibrium or in a monopolistic environment this bundling must yield an efficiency. This efficiency is generated in the following context. A supplier's investment reduces the retailer's cost or boosts the final product's quality, but this investment is not immediately observable and cannot be enforced, hence there exists a moral hazard problem. In this environment, the altruism of the consumer can facilitate a more efficient contract: by paying the supplier more the retailer can both extract more consumer surplus and increase the level of contracted investment, while preserving the supplier's incentive compatibility constraint. We assess our model in the context of the coffee industry. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

About 30{\%} of Americans are obese, which is roughly a 100{\%} increase
from 25 years ago. This study examines the effects of changes in
the racial/ethnic composition and age distribution on the prevalence
of obesity, identifies the portion of the increase in obesity caused
by these changes, and projects the effects of future racial/ethnic
and age changes on obesity using National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey data. Results indicate that racial/ethnic composition changes
and age distribution changes have accounted for about 10{\%} of the
increase in obesity over the last 25 years. However, future racial/ethnic
and age changes are not projected to increase obesity substantially.},

efficiency of international "fair trade" between ethical consumers
and low-income producers. The main analytical innovations are the
reconsideration of the labor supply decision in a state of Keynesian
involuntary unemployment as a choice between work and, not leisure,
but inferior production activities; and the application of Pigou
and Robinson's theory of employer monopsony, leading to a focus on
the "local fair trade organization", which has a similar effect to
a labor union or minimum wage in eliminating monopsony rents. A price
premium is found neither necessary nor sufficient for fair trade,
and in a state of involuntary unemployment a premium does not lead
to inefficient allocation. The conclusion is that fair trade improves
welfare by strengthening competition for labor, and should be encouraged
as a complementary element of an enlightened trade liberalization
policy.},

While these errors have been replicated in multiple studies over the years, most have emerged from highly controlled experimental settings or through consumer surveys that measure only specific categories of financial behavior. This paper extends existing research on financial sophistication by utilizing an ethnographic study conducted over a 5-year time period. Results indicate that while some of the traditional categories of decision errors defined in earlier research affect consumers, decision errors not thoroughly examined in previous academic studies can have a notable and growing effect on consumers' financial decisions. Emerging categories of financial decision errors are identified, and shifts in consumers' financial behavior resulting from the financial crisis are profiled.

abstract = {The paper estimates the returns to education for a cohort of individuals
born in Britain in March 1958 who have been followed since birth
until the age of 33. The data used has a wealth of information on
family background including parental education, social class and
interest shown in the child's education as well as measures of ability.
The nature of our data allows us to directly assess the relative
importance of omitted ability and family background bias as well
as biases arising from measurement error in education quali{\AA}{\pounds}ation
variables which have been found to be important in other studies.
The paper also looks at possible biases arising from compositional
di{\"{A}}--rences between individuals in work and those out of work. This
{\~{N}}{\pounds}omposition bias' arising from self-selection into employment is
generally ignored in the returns to schooling literature and is why
most studies focus only on men (for whom it is assumed this is much
less of a problem). The paper also examines whether there is evidence
of heterogeneity in the returns to education as well as the impact
of education on gender wage di{\"{A}}--rentials. The paper {\AA}{\textregistered}ds that conventional
OLS estimates, which assume that education is exogenous, are reasonable
estimates of the true causal impact of education on wages. In the
UK it would appear that the e{\"{A}}--cts of measurement error bias and
composition bias directly o{\"{A}}--et the countervailing e{\"{A}}--ct of unobserved
ability and family background bias for most quali{\AA}{\pounds}ations. The results
from the paper suggest that conventional OLS estimates of the returns
to education can generally be relied upon for policy decisions. The
paper also {\AA}{\textregistered}ds evidence of heterogeneity in the returns to education
in Britain. The results fromthe paper suggest that individuals undertaking
schooling involving some sort of formal quali{\AA}{\pounds}ation have signi{\AA}{\pounds}antly
larger rates of return than individuals who complete the same number
of years of schooling but who obtain no formal quali{\AA}{\pounds}ations. There
is also some evidence that individuals with lower tastes for education,
have signi{\AA}{\pounds}antly higher marginal returns to certain education quali{\AA}{\pounds}ations.
We also {\AA}{\textregistered}d that post-school quali{\AA}{\pounds}ations, particularly degree quali{\AA}{\pounds}ations,
play an important role in reducing gender wage di{\"{A}}--rentials. The
data used has a wealth of information on family background including

Based on administrative data of applicants for medical schools in Germany, we estimate the effect of tuition fees on the probability of applying for a university in the home state. We find a small but significant reaction: The probability of applying for a university in the home state falls by 2 percentage points (baseline: 69{\%}) for high-school graduates who come from a state with tuition fees. Moreover, we find that students with better high-school grades react more strongly to tuition fees. This might have important effects on the composition of students across states.},

abstract = {Fear of receiving bad news about one's health can lead people to avoid seeking out health information that, ironically, may be crucial for health maintenance. Using a nationally representative US sample, the present study examined whether perceived likelihood of developing cancer and worry about cancer were associated with reports of avoiding visits to one's doctor, in respondents under and over age 50. Cancer worry, but not perceived risk of cancer, predicted doctor avoidance in respondents aged 50 and older, whereas the opposite pattern held for respondents under age 50. Moreover, in respondents aged 50 and older, cancer worry and perceived cancer risk interacted such that cancer worry was linked to doctor avoidance only when respondents also perceived a high likelihood of cancer. The latter result is consistent with the notion that worry may motivate information seeking when people expect information to dispel worry and information avoidance when the information is seen as highly likely to confirm one's fears. Findings suggest a need for communication strategies that can influence worry and perceived risk differentially. Research should also assess the effectiveness of other behavioral strategies (e.g., automatic scheduling of appointments) as a means for reducing doctor avoidance.},

abstract = {Previous experimental and observational work suggests that people act more generously when they are observed and observe others in social settings. However, the explanation for this is unclear. An individual may want to send a signal of her generosity to improve her own reputation. Alternately (or additionally) she may value the public good or charity itself and, believing that contribution levels are strategic complements, give more to influence others to give more. We perform the first series of laboratory experiments that can separately estimate the impact of these two social effects, and test whether realized influence is consistent with the desire to influence, and whether either of these are consistent with anticipated influence. Our experimental subjects were given the opportunity to contribute from their endowment to Bread for the World, a development NGO. Depending on treatment, "leader" subjects' donations were reported to other subjects either anonymously or with their identities, and these were reported either before these "follower" subjects made their donation decisions. We find that "leaders" are influential only when their identities are revealed along with their donations, and female leaders are more influential than males. Identified leaders' predictions suggest that are aware of their influence. They respond to this by giving more than either the control group or the unidentified leaders. We find mixed evidence for "reputation-seeking."},

``Wall Street navigated through some rough patches last year and had a profitable year in 2013. Securities industry employees took home significantly higher bonuses on average,'' DiNapoli said. ``Although profits were lower than the prior year, the industry still had a good year in 2013 despite costly legal settlements and higher interest rates.

abstract = {In this paper, we provide efficient estimators and honest confidence bands for a variety of treatment effects including local average (LATE) and local quantile treatment effects (LQTE) in data-rich environments. We can handle very many control variables, endogenous receipt of treatment, heterogeneous treatment effects, and function-valued outcomes. Our framework covers the special case of exogenous receipt of treatment, either conditional on controls or unconditionally as in randomized control trials. In the latter case, our approach produces efficient estimators and honest bands for (functional) average treatment effects (ATE) and quantile treatment effects (QTE). To make informative inference possible, we assume that key reduced form predictive relationships are approximately sparse. This assumption allows the use of regularization and selection methods to estimate those relations, and we provide methods for post-regularization and post-selection inference that are uniformly valid (honest) across a wide-range of models. We show that a key ingredient enabling honest inference is the use of orthogonal or doubly robust moment conditions in estimating certain reduced form functional parameters. We illustrate the use of the proposed methods with an application to estimating the effect of 401(k) eligibility and participation on accumulated assets.},

and producers in expanding North/South Fair Trade coffee networks.
I develop a commodity network framework that builds on the commodity
chain tradition, integrating insights from cultural studies, actor-network
theory, and conventions approaches. This framework illuminates how
material and ideological relations are negotiated across production
and consumption arenas. In the case of Fair Trade, progressive ideas
and practices related to trust, equality, and global responsibility
are intertwined with traditional commercial and industrial conventions.
As I demonstrate, the negotiation of these divergent conventions
shortens the social distance between Fair Trade coffee consumers
and producers. I conclude that by re-linking consumers and producers,
commodity network analysis provides a robust entr{\'{e}} for academic inquiry

Though it is customary to analyse price discrimination problems by the calculus of variations after postulating a continuum of types, we assume a finite number of types and exploit the geometry and duality of the contract set and the structure of the programming specification. We analyse in detail the qualitative properties of the model's solution and show by construction that our results exhaust the implications of the model for equilibrium contract pairs. We show that imperfect discrimination is not bounded in welfare terms between perfect discrimination and single-price monopoly and that the deadweight loss, consumer surplus and output comparisons between single-price monopoly and imperfect discrimination are ambiguous.},

In the first, laboratory study, subjects were more willing to compensate others who lost money when the losers had already been determined than when they were about to be. In the second, field study, people contributed more to a charity when their contributions would benefit a family that had already been selected from a list than when told that that the family would be selected from the same list.},

abstract = {In the United States, charitable contributions can be deducted from taxable income making the price of giving inversely related to the marginal tax rate. The existing literature documents that charitable giving is very responsive to tax subsidies, but often ignores the spillover effects of such policies. On the other hand, a growing body of literature documents that giving to others reduces the stress and strengthens the immune system, which results in better health and longer life expectancy. These findings imply that tax subsidies for charitable giving may have positive spillover effects on health. This paper investigates this hypothesis using data from Center on Philanthropy Panel Study (COPPS), the philanthropy module of the Panel Study Income Dynamics (PSID). Understanding the spillover effects of charitable subsidies on health is quite important given the existing literature that links health status to several important economic outcomes. The results show that charitable subsidies have positive spillover effects on health. In particular, the implied cross-price elasticity of health index with respect to giving is -0.13. These results are robust to potential endogeneity of income and highlight the positive externalities created by tax subsidies for charitable giving.},

abstract = {sWhile affluent consumers in rich

countries pay several dollars for a cup of

latte at the local Starbucks, millions of

small-scale coffee farmers are struggling

as coffee bean prices have plummeted to

historic lows. The juxtaposition of the

designer coffee boom and rock-bottom

raw material prices strikes market critics

as compelling evidence of unfairness and

exploitation. They blame multinational

coffee roasters and retailers for profiting

at poor farmers' expense, and they propose

a number of schemes-including

-fair trade- coffee, the use of new quality

standards to restrict imports, and the

return to political management of coffee

exports-to help coffee farmers by propping

up coffee bean prices.

The coffee market is clearly far from

the textbook model of frictionless efficiency.

Its adjustment of supply and

demand is subject to long lags and overshooting.

Nevertheless, the story of the

current coffee glut is at bottom a story of

falling costs and productivity improvements

on both the supply and the

demand sides. In particular, prices have

fallen so low primarily because of dramatically

expanded production by low-cost

suppliers in Brazil and Vietnam. And

those low prices are a signal to high-cost

producers-for example, in Central

America-to supply a higher-value product

or exit the market.

However well-intentioned, interventionist

schemes to lift prices above market

levels ignore those market realities.

Accordingly, they are doomed to end in

failure-or to offer cures that are worse

than the disease. There are constructive

measures that can help to ease the plight

of struggling coffee farmers, but they consist

of efforts to improve the market's performance

-not block it or demonize it.},

abstract = {Medical Education 2011: 45: 1032-1040 Objectives- A recent controlled study by our group showed that the dropout rate in the first 2-years of study of medical students selected for entry by the assessment of a combination of non-cognitive and cognitive abilities was 2.6 times lower than that of a control group of students admitted by lottery. The aim of the present study was to compare the performance of these two groups in the clinical phase. Methods- A prospective cohort study was performed to compare the performance of 389 medical students admitted by selection with that of 938 students admitted by weighted lottery between 2001 and 2004. Follow-up of these cohorts lasted 5.5-8.5-years. The main outcome measures were the mean grade obtained on the first five discipline-specific clerkships by all cohorts and the mean grade achieved on all 10 clerkships by the cohorts of 2001 and 2002. Results- Selected students obtained a significantly higher mean grade during their first five clerkships than lottery-admitted students (mean----standard error [SE] 7.95----0.03, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 7.90-8.00 versus mean----SE 7.84----0.02, 95{\%} CI 7.81-7.87; p--0.001). This difference reflected the fact that selected students achieved a grade of ---8.0 1.5 times more often than lottery-admitted students. An analysis of all mean grades awarded on 10 clerkships revealed the same results. Moreover, the longer follow-up period over the clerkships showed that the relative risk for dropout was twice as low in the selected student group as in the lottery-admitted student group. Conclusions- The selected group received significantly higher mean grades on their first five clerkships, which could not be attributed to factors other than the selection procedure. Although the risk for dropout before the clinical phase increased somewhat in both groups, the actual dropout rate proved to be twice as low in the selected group.},

abstract = {Colombia's PACES program provided over 125,000 pupils from poor neighborhoods with vouchers that covered approximately half the cost of private secondary school. Since many vouchers were allocated by lottery, we use differences in outcomes between lottery winners and losers to assess program effects. Three years into the program, lottery winners were 15 percentage points more likely to have attended private school, had completed .1 more years of schooling, and were about 10 percentage points more likely to have finished 8 th grade, primarily because they were less likely to repeat grades. The program did not significantly affect dropout rates. Lottery winners scored .2 standard deviations higher on standardized tests. There is some evidence that winners worked less than losers and were less likely to marry or cohabit as teenagers. On average, lottery winners increased their educational expenditure by about 70{\%} of the value of the voucher. Since winners also worked less, they devoted more total resources to education. Compared to an equivalent expansion of the public education system, the voucher program increased annual government educational expenditure by about 24 per winner. But the costs to the government and to participants were probably much less than the increase in winners' earnings due to greater educational attainment.},

The earnings and schooling results can be reconciled by a flattening of the ageearnings profile in middle age and a modest economic return to the schooling subsidized by the GI Bill. Other long-run consequences of Vietnam-era service include increases in migration and public sector employment.},

In line with this proposition, the effective-altruism movement seeks to provide individuals with information regarding the effectiveness of charities in hopes that they will contribute to organizations that maximize the social return of their donation. In this research, we investigated the extent to which presenting effectiveness information leads people to choose more effective charities. We found that even when effectiveness information is made easily comparable across options, it has a limited impact on choice. Specifically, people frequently choose less effective charity options when those options represent more subjectively preferred causes. In contrast to making a personal donation decision, outcome metrics are used to a much greater extent when choosing financial investments and when allocating aid resources as an agent of an organization. Implications for effective altruism are discussed.},

zero profit socially concerned producer and a profit maximizing

producer) compete over prices and (costly) -socially and environmentally
responsible- features of their products under a

given law of motion of consumer' habits.


In a continuous time model in which the location of the zero profit
social responsible entrant is fixed and the profit maximizing producer
(PMP) limits himself to price competition without ethical imitation,
we show that the optimal dynamic PMP's price is always lower than
his optimal static price since the PMP producer knows that, by leaving
too much market share to the other producer, he will reinforce the
habit of socially responsible consumption and loose further market
share in the future. We inspect the properties of equilibria when
the PMP can ethically

imitate the entrant and when the entrant is free to choose his location.
We find that, in the first case, the threshold

triggering a PMP strategy of ethical imitation and minimum price differentiation
is lower in the dynamic than in the static case,

depending on the PMP's shadow cost of changes in consumers social
responsibility.},

abstract = {We survey 1050 consumers who have just redeemed one or more open loop gift certificates to learn whether they view gift certificate income, cash gifts and non-gift income as substitutes. We find that the majority (83{\%}) of recipients spend the certificates in the same way as cash. The other respondents (17{\%}) bought an item they would not have bought otherwise but adjustments in their shopping pattern do not seem to result from constraints in redeeming the certificates: 80{\%} of all respondents in this group says they have used the certificate to buy an item they really love to have. While inconsistent with standard microeconomic demand theory, this behavior can be explained by narrow bracketing: in spending gift certificates, these consumers consider a limited choice set of nice, personal items. Our data show that females are more likely to narrow bracket gift certificate income and that positive reciprocity towards the giver induces narrow bracketing in case the giver is a household member who suggests to buy a particular item using the certificate. Previous studies have found that both giving in-kind gifts (Waldfogel, 1993) as giving gift cards (Offenberg, 2007) entail a welfare loss of 10-30{\%} when compared to giving cash. We find that the welfare effects of open loop gift certificates among users are limited: the consumption of broad bracketing consumers is unaffected and narrow bracketing consumers seem to value the possibility to separate gift certificate income from other income sources.},

abstract = {The decision of whether to control for covariates, and how to select which covariates to include, is ubiquitous in psychological research. Failing to control for valid covariates can yield biased parameter estimates in correlational analyses or in imperfectly randomized experiments and contributes to underpowered analyses even in effectively randomized experiments. We introduce double-lasso regression as a principle method for variable selection. The double lasso method is calibrated to not over-select potentially spurious covariates, and simulations demonstrate that using this method reduces error and increases statistical power. This method can be used to identify which covariates have sufficient empirical support for inclusion in analyses of correlations, moderation, mediation and experimental interventions, as well as to test for the effectiveness of randomization. We illustrate both the method's usefulness and how to implement it in practice by applying it to four analyses from the prior literature, using both correlational and experimental data.},

different types of players (in this case, nonprofit, co-operative

the factors that have led

Fair Trade to become a mixed-form market and (2) to propose some trails

start by defining briefly Fair Trade, its different dimensions (including
the -fair- quality of the

products) and its organizational landscape, focusing on the distinction
between the pioneer

-Alternative Trading Organizations- and the second-mover companies.
Then, we recall the

theoretical emergence factors for each type of organization (nonprofit,
co-operative and for-

profit) and apply these emergence factors to the context of Fair Trade.
This analysis allows us

to capture the specificities of each type of operator with regard
to Fair Trade and, thus, to have

a better understanding of the competition dynamics in the sector.
The latter analysis includes

elements on ethical imitation, consumers' behaviors, effects on welfare
and the role of the

government, in order to outline some of the major trends in this rapidly

abstract = {This paper examines an affirmative action program for "lower-caste" groups in engineering colleges in India. We study both the targeting properties of the program, and its implications for labor market outcomes. We find that affirmative action successfully targets the financially disadvantaged: the upper-caste applicants that are displaced by affirmative action come from a richer economic background than the lower-caste applicants that are displacing them. Targeting by caste, however, may lead to the exclusion of other disadvantaged groups. For example, caste-based targeting reduces the overall number of females entering engineering colleges. We find that despite poor entrance exam scores, lower-caste entrants obtain a positive return to admission. Our estimates, however, also suggest that these gains may come at an absolute cost because the income losses experienced by displaced upper-caste applicants are larger than the income gains experienced by displacing lower-caste students. Limited sample sizes in our preferred econometric specifications, however, prevent us from drawing strong conclusions from these labor market findings. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research indicates that certain personality traits relate to performance in the medical profession. Yet, personality testing during selection seems ineffective. In this study, we examine the extent to which different medical school selection processes call upon desirable personality characteristics in applicants.: 1019 of all 1055 students who entered the Dutch Bachelor of Medicine at University of Groningen, the Netherlands in 2009, 2010 and 2011 were included in this study. Students were admitted based on either top pre-university grades (n = 139), acceptance in a voluntary multifaceted selection process (n = 286), or lottery weighted for pre-university GPA. Within the lottery group, we distinguished between students who had not participated (n = 284) and students who were initially rejected (n = 310) in the voluntary selection process. Two months after admission, personality was assessed with the NEO-FFI, a measure of the five factor model of personality. We performed ANCOVA modelling with gender as a covariate to examine personality differences between the four groups.: The multifaceted selection group scored higher on extraversion than all other groups(p0.01), higher on conscientiousness than both lottery-admitted groups(p0.01), and lower on neuroticism than the lottery-admitted group that had not participated in the voluntary selection process. The latter group scored lower on conscientiousness than all other groups(p0.05) and lower on agreeableness than the multifaceted selection group and the top pre-university group(p0.01).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Differences between the four admission groups, though statistically significant, were relatively small. Personality scores in the group admitted through the voluntary multifaceted selection process seemed most fit for the medical profession. Personality scores in the lottery-admitted group that had not participated in this process seemed least fit for the medical profession. It seems that in order to select applicants with suitable personalities, an admission process that calls upon desirable personality characteristics is beneficial.},

Medvec et al. argued that bronze medalists compared themselves to
4th place finishers, whereas silver medalists compared themselves
to gold medalists. These counterfactuals were the most salient because
they were either qualitatively different (gold vs. silver) or categorically
different (medal vs. no medal) from what actually occurred. Drawing
on archival data and experimental studies, we show that Olympic athletes
(among others) are more likely to make counterfactual comparisons
based on their prior expectations, consistent with decision affect
theory. Silver medalists are more likely to be disappointed because
their personal expectations are higher than those of bronze medalists.
We provide a test between expectancy-based versus category-based
processing and discuss circumstances that trigger each type of processing.},

factors influencing donations, these models provide a way to unmask
features that are not evident in the raw data, such as trends in
giving behavior and exceptional performances by particular classes

years. While consumers have been surveyed regarding their perceptions
of ethical business and marketing practices, research has been minimal

investigates general attitudes of consumers relative to business,
government and people in general, and compares these attitudes to
their beliefs concerning various questionable consumer practices.
The results show that consumers'' ethical beliefs are determined,
in part, by who is at fault in the unethical behavior (the seller
or the buyer). The results also indicate that those with a more positive
attitude toward business are less likely to engage in questionable
consumer practices, but one''s attitudes toward salespeople, the
government and people in general arenot related to the consumer''s

abstract = {Decisions involving charitable giving often occur under the shadow of risk. A common finding is that potential donors give less when there is greater risk that their donation will have less impact. While this behavior could be fully rationalized by standard economic models, this paper shows that an additional mechanism is relevant: the use of risk as an excuse not to give. In a laboratory study, participants evaluate risky payoffs for themselves and risky payoffs for a charity. When their decisions do not involve tradeoffs between money for themselves and the charity, they respond very similarly to self risk and charity risk. By contrast, when their decisions force tradeoffs between money for themselves and the charity, participants act more averse to charity risk and less averse to self risk. These altered responses to risk bias participants towards choosing payoffs for themselves more often, consistent with excuse-driven responses to risk. Additional results support the existence of excuse-driven types.},

We propose a model that allows the control and treatment groups to have different average benefits from the treatment. The assumptions of the proposed model are invariant to the scaling of the outcome. We provide conditions under which the model is nonparametrically identified and propose an estimator that can be applied using either repeated cross section or panel data. Our approach provides an estimate of the entire counterfactual distribution of outcomes that would have been experienced by the treatment group in the absence of the treatment and likewise for the untreated group in the presence of the treatment. Thus, it enables the evaluation of policy interventions according to criteria such as a mean-variance trade-off. We also propose methods for inference, showing that our estimator for the average treatment effect is root-N consistent and asymptotically normal. We consider extensions to allow for covariates, discrete dependent variables, and multiple groups and time periods.},

abstract = {When facing a decision, people often rely on advice received from others. Previous studies have shown that people tend to discount others' opinions. Yet, such discounting varies according to several factors. This paper isolates one of these factors: the cost of advice. Specifically, three experiments investigate whether the cost of advice, independent of its quality, affects how people use advice. The studies use the Judge-Advisor System (JAS) to investigate whether people value advice from others more when it costs money than when it is free, and examine the psychological processes that could account for this effect. The results show that people use paid advice significantly more than free advice and suggest that this effect is due to the same forces that have been documented in the literature to explain the sunk costs fallacy. Implications for circumstances under which people value others' opinions are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

If they do, is it because the grants crowd out donors who feel they gave through taxes (classic crowd out), or is it because the grant crowds out the fundraising of the charities who, after getting the grant, reduce efforts of fundraising (fundraising crowd-out)? This is the first paper to separate these two effects. Using a panel of more than 8000 charities, we find that crowding out is significant, at about 75{\%}. We find this crowding out is due primarily to reduced fundraising. Depending on which types of organizations are included in the analysis, crowding out attributable to classic crowd-out ranges from 30{\%} to a slight crowd-in effect, while fundraising crowd-out ranges from 70{\%} to over 100{\%} of all crowd-out. Such a finding could have important consequences for how governments structure grants to non-profits. Our results indicate, for example, that requirements that charities match a fraction of government grants with increases in private donations might be a feasible policy that could reduce the detrimental effects of crowding out. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

a large contribution by a single wealthy donor? This paper explores
the possibility that such "leadership giving" provides a signal to
all other givers that the charity is of high quality. The dilemma
is that if the lead giver can deceive others to believe the charity
is of higher quality than it truly is, then these followers will
make larger contributions, which will benefit the leader. Hence,
the leader must give an unusually large amount to convey a credible
signal of the quality. This sets up a war-of-attrition game for who
will pay the cost to signal the quality. Since the wealthy have the
lowest opportunity cost of providing the signal, they, in equilibrium,
move first to provide the signal of quality with exceptionally large

@article{Yoruk2009,
abstract = {People are more likely to contribute to a charity when they are asked to. Although this so-called 'power of asking' is well-known among fundraisers, the existing literature does not pay much attention to the role of donation requests in charitable giving. This paper uses a unique survey that includes a question on whether the respondent is asked to give to estimate the causal effects of charitable solicitations on giving behavior. In order to address the endogeneity of the donation requests due to non-random solicitation of charitable donors, I link this survey to IRS data on charitable organizations and propose identifying instruments. After controlling for the endogeneity, I find that donation requests increase the propensity to give by about nineteen percentage points for those who are asked to give. This effect is robust under different specifications and with different sets of instruments, and is much larger than the estimates from univariate models, which assume that charitable solicitations are exogenous. I argue that this result is counterintuitive and discuss some possible explanations.},

to investigate the relevance of gift exchange in a natural setting.
In collaboration with a charitable organization, we sent roughly
10,000 solicitation letters to potential donors. One-third of the
letters contained no gift, one-third contained a small gift, and
one-third contained a large gift. Treatment assignment was random.
The results confirm the economic importance of gift exchange. Compared
to the no gift condition, the relative frequency of donations increased
by 17 percent if a small gift was included and by 75 percent for
a large gift. The study extends the current body of research on gift
exchange, which is almost exclusively confined to laboratory studies.},

One explanation is that education appears to have a double effect on the earnings of women. It increases their skills and productivity, as it does with men, and in addition it appears to reduce the gap in male and female earnings attributable to factors such as discrimination, tastes, and circumstances. The latter appear to account for about half of the differential in the returns to schooling.},

abstract = {Consumers have shown a willingness to pay a premium for products labeled as -FT- and a preference for retailers that are seen to be more generous to their suppliers/employees. A FT product is essentially a bundle of a base product and a donation to the supplier (e.g., a coffee farmer). An altruistic rational consumer will only choose this bundle if doing so is less expensive than buying the base product and making a direct donation. For FT to be sustainable either in a competitive equilibrium or in a monopolistic environment this bundling must yield an efficiency. This efficiency is generated in the following context. A supplier's investment reduces the retailer's cost or boosts the final product's quality, but this investment is not immediately observable and cannot be enforced, hence there exists a moral hazard problem. In this environment, the altruism of the consumer can facilitate a more efficient contract: by paying the supplier more the retailer can both extract more consumer surplus and increase the level of contracted investment, while preserving the supplier's incentive compatibility constraint. We assess our model in the context of the coffee industry.},

abstract = {The existing literature on socially responsible purchasing relies
heavily on stated preference measures elicited through surveys that
utilize hypothetical market choices. This paper explores consumers'
revealed purchasing behavior with regard to fair trade coffee and
is apparently the first to do so in an actual market setting. In
a series of experiments, we investigated differences in consumer
responsiveness to relative price changes in fair trade and non-fair
trade brewed coffees. In order to minimize the hypothetical bias
that may be present in some experimental settings, we conducted our
experiments in cooperation with a vendor who allowed us to vary prices
in an actual coffee shop. Using a choice model, we found that purchasers
of fair trade coffee were much less price responsive than those of
other coffee products. The demonstration of low sensitivity to price
suggests that the market premiums identified by stated preference
studies do indeed exist and are not merely artifacts of hypothetical
settings.},

abstract = {Abstract:

Although economists have long been aware of Jensen's inequality, many
econometric applications have neglected an important implication
of it: the standard practice of interpreting the parameters of log-linearized
models estimated by ordinary least squares as elasticities can be
highly misleading in the presence of heteroskedasticity. This paper
explains why this problem arises and proposes an appropriate estimator.
Our criticism of conventional practices and the solution we propose
extends to a broad range of economic applications where the equation
under study is log-linearized. We develop the argument using one
particular illustration, the gravity equation for trade, and apply
the proposed technique to provide new estimates of this equation.
We find significant differences between estimates obtained with the
proposed estimator and those obtained with the traditional method.},

It will be analysed both thechoice made before enrolling at university and that one made after obtaining adegree. Data drawing from the last sample survey on employment conditions ofthe Italian students graduated in 2004 three years after obtaining their degree(2007), led by the Italian National Statistics Institute (ISTAT), will be used. Twoindices - one for research quality and the other one for teaching quality - willbe used as indicators of university quality, developed by using the results of thefirst government evaluation of Italian university research carried out by the InterministerialCommittee for Research Evaluation (2007). The results confirmthat the quality of university teaching and research significantly influence migrationmovements of Italian students. Furthermore, since most students tend to remainin the province where they carried out their university studies, after theirdegree, the results show that the basic choice for accumulating human capital--in loco-- - which could be the subject of appropriate policies - is that madewhen choosing the university. It is from this point of view that --university quality-- represents a potential instrument of --intervention-- in order to counterbalancethe negative effects of brain drain on the accumulation of human capital inthe regions where migration flows originate.},

the incorporation of ethical considerations into consumers'' purchase
decisions, this paper explores the notion of an ethical product.
It is argued that ethical issues have long been involved in consumers''
product evaluations, but that there has been little academic investigation
of ethics in terms of product concepts and theories. Ethics are thus
examined in the context of the augmented product concept, and two
dimensions of ethical augmentation are identified: direction and
content. These dimensions are set out and discussed at some length,
and then they are used to construct an ethical product matrix. It
is shown how this could be used to provide structure and coherence
to examinations of the perceived ethics of any given product offering.
The implications of the analysis offered in the paper are discussed,
and a number of limitations of the ethical product notion are identified.
Finally some conclusions and directions for future research are suggested.},

hypothesis, extremeness aversion, states that the attractiveness
of an option is enhanced if it is an intermediate option in the choice

In the context of ordinary significance-testing analysis, optional stopping is discouraged, because it necessarily leads to increased type I error rates over nominal values. This article addresses whether optional stopping is problematic for Bayesian inference with Bayes factors. Statisticians who developed Bayesian methods thought not, but this wisdom has been challenged by recent simulation results of Yu, Sprenger, Thomas, and Dougherty (2013) and Sanborn and Hills (2013). In this article, I show through simulation that the interpretation of Bayesian quantities does not depend on the stopping rule. Researchers using Bayesian methods may employ optional stopping in their own research and may provide Bayesian analysis of secondary data regardless of the employed stopping rule. I emphasize here the proper interpretation of Bayesian quantities as measures of subjective belief on theoretical positions, the difference between frequentist and Bayesian interpretations, and the difficulty of using frequentist intuition to conceptualize the Bayesian approach.},

abstract = {A number of experimental studies have documented that financial rewards
discourage the performance of altruistic activities because they
conflict with intrinsic altruistic motivations. However, it is unclear
whether this is evidence of a generalized aversion to rewards or,
rather, an aversion to receiving specific material prizes, such as
cash. We conducted a randomized-controlled experiment, through a
survey administered to 467 blood donors in an Italian town, and found
that donors are not reluctant to receive compensation in general;
a substantial share of respondents declared that they would stop
being donors if given 10 Euros in cash, but we do not find such effects
when a voucher of the same nominal value is offered instead. The
aversion to direct cash payments is particularly marked among women,
but does not emerge among individuals who have only recently become
donors. All of our findings are robust to regression analyses. Implications
for research and public policy are discussed.},

abstract = {Costly life-saving interventions can often be described not only in terms ofthe num-ber of lives that may be saved but also in terms of the proportion of lives saved out of some total number at risk. In a phenomenon that has been referred to as psychophysical numbing (PN), Fetherstonhaugh, Slovic, Johnson, and Friedrich (1997) found that participants rated an intervention saving a fixed number of lives to be less worth investing in when more total lives were at risk (i,e,, when saved lives represented a smaller proportion of the total threat or problem). In two new experi-ments, life-valuation correlates of PN responding, as well as manipulations of death salience, accountability, and economics focus, were explored in the context of stu-dents' willingness to support mandatory antilock brake requirements for new cars, PN responding was pervasive, but non-PN responders were clearly distinguished by the greater overall value they placed on saving lives. Salience and accountability manipu-lations did not debias judgments but did tend to rule out low-effort processing as an explanation for these quantity confusions. An emphasis on economic considerations was consistently related to greater PN responding. As participants in a larger social system, each of us is routinely called on to make judgments concerning the appropriateness of mandating risk-reducing and life-saving interventions. Many decisions of this type (e,g,, requiring costly auto safety features to prevent some number of injuries or deaths) have substantial con-sp,quences for consumers. How do we make such decisions? The dynamics influ-encing our choices are no doubt a complicated interplay of attitudes and ideology Requests for reprints should be sent to},

of obesity, identifies the portion of the increase in obesity caused
by these changes, and projects the effects of future racial/ethnic

money to charity led to higher levels of happiness only when participants
gave to causes that explained how these funds are used to make a
difference in the life of a recipient. In Study 2, participants were
asked to reflect upon a time they spent money on themselves or on
others in a way that either had a positive impact or had no impact.
Participants who recalled a time they spent on others that had a
positive impact were happiest. Together, these results suggest that
highlighting the impact of prosocial spending can increase the emotional

abstract = {Two main reasons why people donate to charity are that they have been asked and asked by someone they care about. One would therefore expect that charitable organizations could benefit from peer-to-peer fundraising if they were able to persuade donors to do so for them. However, little is known on the costs and benefits of asking donors to fundraise. We investigate this by implementing a field experiment embedded in an online giving organization's web page. In our experiment, donors who have completed an online transaction were randomly asked to share having donated by posting on their Facebook (FB) wall or by sending a private message to a friend on FB. To further explore the impact of incentives on the willingness to fundraise, donors were also assigned to one of three treatments in which the organization added either {\$}0, {\$}1 or {\$}5 in the donor's name in exchange for sharing the information. We have several findings: (1) Donors respond to incentives: larger add-on donations increase the willingness to post having made a donation. (2) Nuisance costs may be important: willingness to post is over two times higher among those already logged into FB. (3) The type of ask matters: willingness to post via one's wall or via a private message is different. (4) There are benefits to incentivizing peer-to-peer fundraising in increased new donations. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Based on principles of comparative advantage, scholars commonly presume that positive selection is at work, that is, individuals who are most likely to select into college also benefit most from college. Net of observed economic and noneconomic factors influencing college attendance, we conjecture that individuals who are least likely to obtain a college education benefit the most from college. We call this theory the negative selection hypothesis. To adjudicate between the two hypotheses, we study the effects of completing college on earnings by propensity score strata using an innovative hierarchical linear model with data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. For both cohorts, for both men and women, and for every observed stage of the life course, we find evidence suggesting negative selection. Results from auxiliary analyses lend further support to the negative selection hypothesis.},

sample of 4,242 alumni (1926/27-1989/90 graduates) who gave cash
gifts during the 1975/76-1989/90 fiscal years. The covariance regression
model results indicate lack of statistically significant difference
between gift-giving women and men. However, the School of Business
graduates, alumni who proceeded to obtain graduate degrees from this
university, and alumni members of non-Greek social organizations
gave significantly more. Moreover, alumni contributions varied systematically
over the business cycle and a 1962 Federal Court Order to desegregate
the university racially reduced donations but not significantly.
Given the 63-year cycle studied, the growth rates of alumni donations
of money are projected to decline after roughly age 52, which falls
short of the typical retirement age.},

to overuse-the 'tragedy of the commons'-emerges in many social dilemmas,
such as our inability to sustain the global climate. Public goods
experiments, which are used to study this type of problem, usually
confirm that the collective benefit will not be produced. Because
individuals and countries often participate in several social games
simultaneously, the interaction of these games may provide a sophisticated
way by which to maintain the public resource. Indirect reciprocity,
'give and you shall receive', is built on reputation and can sustain
a high level of cooperation, as shown by game theorists. Here we
show, through alternating rounds of public goods and indirect reciprocity
games, that the need to maintain reputation for indirect reciprocity
maintains contributions to the public good at an unexpectedly high
level. But if rounds of indirect reciprocation are not expected,
then contributions to the public good drop quickly to zero. Alternating
the games leads to higher profits for all players. As reputation
may be a currency that is valid in many social games, our approach
could be used to test social dilemmas for their solubility.},

of 61 positive affect conditions in which it was possible to generate
an effect-size estimate corresponding to the relative degree of helpfulness
exhibited by positive mood subjects (compared with neutral affect
subjects), judges assessed the contextual levels of variables relevant
to each of the six hypotheses by reading the Method section of each
article. Higher-order partial correlation coefficients were then
calculated to isolate the independent contribution of each of the
theoretically relevant variables to the variation among the 61 effect
sizes. The results support the focus of attention, separate process,
social outlook, and mood maintenance hypotheses, and partially support
the objective self-awareness and concomitance hypotheses. (PsycINFO

abstract = {Colombia's PACES program provided over 125,000 pupils from poor neighborhoods with vouchers that covered approximately half the cost of private secondary school. Since many vouchers were allocated by lottery, we use differences in outcomes between lottery winners and losers to assess program effects. Three years into the program, lottery winners were 15 percentage points more likely to have attended private school, had completed .1 more years of schooling, and were about 10 percentage points more likely to have finished 8 th grade, primarily because they were less likely to repeat grades. The program did not significantly affect dropout rates. Lottery winners scored .2 standard deviations higher on standardized tests. There is some evidence that winners worked less than losers and were less likely to marry or cohabit as teenagers. On average, lottery winners increased their educational expenditure by about 70{\%} of the value of the voucher. Since winners also worked less, they devoted more total resources to education. Compared to an equivalent expansion of the public education system, the voucher program increased annual government educational expenditure by about 24 per winner. But the costs to the government and to participants were probably much less than the increase in winners' earnings due to greater educational attainment.},

attitudes, as it has been shown to be in other domains of consumer

in the buying situation more likely: environmental concern and the
absence of other highly involving characteristics. The paper presents
a study of a case with these two characteristics: Danish consumers'
choice of environment-friendly packaging. With regard to this case,
the evidence supports the claim. A majority of Danish consumers have
developed personal norms about choosing environment-friendly packaging
and the personal norm is a significant predictor of their (self-reported)
propensity to choose environment-friendly packaging in the supermarket
(whereas perceived costs have a minor influence on the choice). It
is recommended that attempts to promote this and similar behaviour
focus on strengthening consumers' intrinsic motivation and on facilitating
its transformation into behaviour.},

abstract = {Consumers have shown a willingness to pay a premium for products labeled as -FT- and a preference for retailers that are seen to be more generous to their suppliers/employees. A FT product is essentially a bundle of a base product and a donation to the supplier (e.g., a coffee farmer). An altruistic rational consumer will only choose this bundle if doing so is less expensive than buying the base product and making a direct donation. For FT to be sustainable either in a competitive equilibrium or in a monopolistic environment this bundling must yield an efficiency. This efficiency is generated in the following context. A supplier's investment reduces the retailer's cost or boosts the final product's quality, but this investment is not immediately observable and cannot be enforced, hence there exists a moral hazard problem. In this environment, the altruism of the consumer can facilitate a more efficient contract: by paying the supplier more the retailer can both extract more consumer surplus and increase the level of contracted investment, while preserving the supplier's incentive compatibility constraint. We assess our model in the context of the coffee industry.},

abstract = {In an increasingly risky and globalized marketplace, people must be able to make well-informed financial decisions. Yet new international research demonstrates that financial illiteracy is widespread when financial markets are well developed as in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Japan, Italy, New Zealand, and the United States, or when they are changing rapidly as in Russia. Further, across these countries, we show that the older population believes itself well informed, even though it is actually less well informed than average. Other common patterns are also evident: women are less financially literate than men and are aware of this shortfall. More educated people are more informed, yet education is far from a perfect proxy for literacy. There are also ethnic/racial and regional differences: city-dwellers in Russia are better informed than their rural counterparts, while in the U.S., African Americans and Hispanics are relatively less financially literate than others. Moreover, the more financially knowledgeable are also those most likely to plan for retirement. In fact, answering one additional financial question correctly is associated with a 3-4 percentage point higher chance of planning for retirement in countries as diverse as Germany, the U.S., Japan, and Sweden; in the Netherlands, it boosts planning by 10 percentage points. Finally, using instrumental variables, we show that these estimates probably underestimate the effects of financial literacy on retirement planning. In sum, around the world, financial literacy is critical to retirement security.},

abstract = {New graduates of elite MBA programs flock to Wall Street during bull markets and start their careers elsewhere when the stock market is weak. Given the transferability of MBA skills, it seems likely that any effect of stock returns on MBA placement would be short-lived. In this paper, I use a survey of Stanford MBAs from the classes of 1960 through 1997 to analyze the relationship between the state of financial market at graduation, initial job placement, and long- term labor market outcomes. Using stock market conditions at graduation as an instrument for first job, I show that there is a strong causal effect of initial placement in investment banking on the likelihood of working on Wall Street anywhere from three to twenty years later. I then measure the investment banking compensation premium relative to other jobs and estimate the additional income generated by anMBA cohort where a higher fraction starts in higher-paid jobs relative to a cohort that starts in lower-paid areas. The results lead to several conclusions. First, random factors play an important role in determining the industries and incomes of members of this high-skill group. Second, there is a deep pool of potential investment bankers in any given Stanford MBA class. During the time these people are in school, factors beyond their control sort them into or out of banking upon graduation. Finally, industry-specificortask-specific human capital appears to be important for young investment bankers.},

Altruistic acts could thus be more generous if subjects prefer that
monies go toward other players, or charities, than be left on the
table. On the other hand, revealed altruism could be lower if subjects
are more altruistic toward the residual claimant than they are toward
the agent to whom they are being asked to give. We demonstrate this
point with simple laboratory experiments that derive from popular
recent designs. We find a significant effect from the hypothesized
confound, with revealed altruism dependent upon who is specified

The insider makes positive profits by exploiting his monopoly power optimally in a dynamic context, where noise trading provides camou- flage which conceals his trading from market makers. As the time interval between auctions goes to zero, a limiting model of continuous trading is obtained. In this equilibrium, prices follow Brownian motion, the depth of the market is constant over time, and all private information is incorporated into prices by the end of trading.},

especially in the field of

behavioral economics. However, it is still debated to what extent
results from laboratory

experiments can be applied to field settings. One highly important
question with respect to the

external validity of experiments is whether the same individuals act
in experiments as they would

in the field.

This paper presents evidence on how individuals behave in donation
experiments and how the

same individuals behave in a naturally occurring decision situation
on charitable giving. The

results show that behavior in experiments is correlated with behavior
in the field. The results are

robust to variations in the experimental setting, and the correlation
between experimental and

field behavior is between 0.25 and 0.4. We discuss whether this correlation
should be interpreted

as strong or weak and what consequences the findings have for experimental
economics.},

abstract = {European labor markets are characterized by the low geographical mobility of workers. The absence of mobility is a factor behind high unemployment when jobless people prefer to remain in their home region rather than to go prospecting in more dynamic areas. In this paper, we attempt to understand the determinants of mobility by introducing the concept of local social capital. Using data from a European household panel (ECHP), we provide various measures of social capital, which appears to be a strong factor of immobility. It is also a fairly large factor of unemployment when social capital is clearly local, while other types of social capital are found to have a positive effect on employability. We also find evidence of the reciprocal causality, that is, individuals born in another region have accumulated less local social capital. Finally, observing that individuals in the South of Europe appear to accumulate more local social capital, while in Northern Europe they tend to invest in more general types of social capital, we argue that part of the European unemployment puzzle can be better understood thanks to the concept of local social capital.},

the incorporation of ethical considerations into consumers'' purchase
decisions, this paper explores the notion of an ethical product.
It is argued that ethical issues have long been involved in consumers''
product evaluations, but that there has been little academic investigation
of ethics in terms of product concepts and theories. Ethics are thus
examined in the context of the augmented product concept, and two
dimensions of ethical augmentation are identified: direction and
content. These dimensions are set out and discussed at some length,
and then they are used to construct an ethical product matrix. It
is shown how this could be used to provide structure and coherence
to examinations of the perceived ethics of any given product offering.
The implications of the analysis offered in the paper are discussed,
and a number of limitations of the ethical product notion are identified.
Finally some conclusions and directions for future research are suggested.},

abstract = {Abstract: This paper estimates the impact of schooling on the wages
of men. It is important to know what the return on educational investments
might be since a high return implies that there might be too little
of such investments. The major preoccupation in this literature has
been attempting to unravel the simultaneous relationship between
schooling and wages. That is, wages depend on schooling since schooling
enhances human capital, but schooling decisions depend on wages for
one or more of a number of reasons - for example, individuals will
invest in more schooling the greater is the return to that schooling.
Traditional estimates of the return to an additional year of schooling
in the UK suggest that this is in of the order of 7{\%}. However, the
results here suggest much larger figures - perhaps in the order of
20{\%}. We use a large sample of UK males to address the potential endogeneity
of schooling. By exploiting the experimental nature of two changes
in the minimum school leaving age to uncover the effect of an exogenous
increase in schooling on wages. Our results confirm recent US work.
For example, Card (1993) and Butcher and Case (1994) suggest that
the estimates of schooling returns using such methods are almost
double that of simple least squares methods. However, the results
here provide much greater precision than has previously been the
case and so substantiate the US evidence of much larger rates of
return to education than traditionally thought.},

@article{Andreoni2004,
abstract = {Laboratory researchers in economics assiduously protect the confidentiality
of subjects. Why? Presumably because they fear that the social consequences
of identifying subjects and their choices would significantly alter
the economic incentives of the game. But these may be the same social
effects that institutions, like charitable fund-raising, are manipulating
to help overcome free riding and to promote economic efficiency.
We present an experiment that unmasks subjects in a systematic and
controlled way. We show that, as intuition suggests, identifying
subjects has significant effects. Surprisingly, we found that two
supplemental conditions meant to mimic common fund-raising practices
actually had the most dramatic influences on behavior.


6. Conclusion


This paper set out to understand whether removing confidentiality
affects giving in a series of public goods experiments. We systematically
alter the identification of subjects and information on their contributions.
By unmasking subjects, we allow for various social effects, like
pride, shame, social comparison and prestige, to work. If identity
and information matter, this raises the natural question: have fund-raising
institutions been tailored to take advantage of these effects? To
get a glimpse into fund-raising strategies, we also conducted two
additional treatments. The first allows subjects the option of giving
anonymously. The second reports contributions in categories. This
allows us to observe whether these particular fund-raising practices
may have special merit, and if they may be worth studying in more
detail.


We found, first, that identity and information can matter. Knowing
only the distribution of contributions, but not the identity of the
givers, has no discernible effect. Knowing only the identity but
not the individual contributions has a modest effect of increasing
donations. However, knowing both who is in your group and what each
is choosing can significantly increase giving. Identification tends
to decrease free riding, and the combination of information and identification
tends to increase contributions.


Looking more deeply, we discovered that some people consistently set
a -good example' by contributing large amounts in the first period.
We found that the announcement structure has an important effect
on the number of these leaders and their ability to lead. Surprisingly,
leaders emerge most strongly when they can voluntarily report their
contribution to the rest of the group. Moreover, as social comparison
suggests, their role in the group is important as they appear to
increase the contribution levels of others. Along with the leaders,
we also uncovered laggards who consistently give small amounts in
the first period. Laggards, we found, are cowardly. They emerge when
information on actions and actors is noisy, and they cannot be easily
identified. Even more insidious is that their presence appears to
decrease the contributions of others. It seems the best way to deal
with laggards is to make their actions and identities known.


Second, and perhaps surprisingly, we found that two popular fund-raising
practices had significant impacts on behavior. For the option to
remain anonymous we found that, while few chose to do so, having
the option to contribute anonymously increased contributions to their
highest level and produced the most leaders. That is, giving people
the option to report their contributions results in more giving than
required reporting. It would appear that something about empowering
people with the choice to announce their contributions-even though
it is a -false' choice that no one would reject-might actually focus
them more on being leaders and example setters. This suggests that
indeed charities may be taking advantage of subtle behavioral effects
in designing this feature of the giving institution.


Categories also have the potential to affect contributions by significantly
shifting the distribution of contributions. This confirms [Harbaugh,
1998b] research, which incorporates a prestige motive to giving.
People tend to contribute at the lower end of the contribution category,
and some people give more to be in the higher category. Our results
suggest that carefully constructing the reporting categories has
the potential to significantly increase contributions.


The research we presented here suggests a broad set of new questions
for economic researchers, both theorists and experimenters. The effects
that economists factor out of their experiments and, to a large extent,
out of theoretical models may be the very effects that fund-raising
institutions may be using to help overcome free riding and promote
efficiency. This suggests that there may be much to be gained by
shifting our research toward understanding individual preferences,
social effects, and the institutions designed to take advantage of
them. Indeed, this research could be seen as a first step at collecting
the kind of information that may be useful to inform a theoretical
model of fund-raising practices. s},

In evaluating alternative specifications, we settle on a fixed-effects estimation. Social welfare charities are shown to fund raise short of the point at which net revenues are maximized, whereas health and overseas charities are found to net revenue maximize. Religious charities maximize total revenues. Estimates of price and fund-raising elasticities are presented for charities overall and for four cohorts. For alternative income sources, no evidence of crowding-out is found.},

abstract = {In an increasingly risky and globalized marketplace, people must be able to make well-informed financial decisions. Yet new international research demonstrates that financial illiteracy is widespread when financial markets are well developed as in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Japan, Italy, New Zealand, and the United States, or when they are changing rapidly as in Russia. Further, across these countries, we show that the older population believes itself well informed, even though it is actually less well informed than average. Other common patterns are also evident: women are less financially literate than men and are aware of this shortfall. More educated people are more informed, yet education is far from a perfect proxy for literacy. There are also ethnic/racial and regional differences: city-dwellers in Russia are better informed than their rural counterparts, while in the U.S., African Americans and Hispanics are relatively less financially literate than others. Moreover, the more financially knowledgeable are also those most likely to plan for retirement. In fact, answering one additional financial question correctly is associated with a 3-4 percentage point higher chance of planning for retirement in countries as diverse as Germany, the U.S., Japan, and Sweden; in the Netherlands, it boosts planning by 10 percentage points. Finally, using instrumental variables, we show that these estimates probably underestimate the effects of financial literacy on retirement planning. In sum, around the world, financial literacy is critical to retirement security.},

Yet many real life situations involve insiders, who are directly affected by a dilemma, and outsiders, who may be harmed if the insiders overcome the dilemma. The quintessential illustration is oligopoly. If insiders overcome their dilemma and collude, this inflicts harm on the opposite market side. In our experiment, harm on outsiders significantly reduces conditional cooperation of insiders. We can exclude that this result is driven by inequity aversion, reciprocity or efficiency seeking. Only guilt aversion can rationalize our findings, with guilt being most pronounced if the active insiders not only inflict harm on the outsider, but increase their own payoff at the expense of the outsider.},

However, it is not clear how research has addressed this issue and how much is know about retirement saving decisions. With this paper, we provided two major contributions to the literature on retirement saving. As a starting point, we developed a general chart of retirement saving choices, extending the work of Hurd and Panis (2006). These authors focused exclusively on choices at job change or retirement age and we extended their diagram to all main decisions at each stage of retirement saving, providing a more comprehensive framework. We then used this diagram as the yardstick to perform the systematic review and evaluate the breadth of research in the last 20 years. We found 130 papers and identified the most studied retirement choices and the under- researched areas. Most papers focused on asset allocation, decision to save and contribution rate. Less attention was given to decisions at retirement age and voluntary savings. Furthermore, very few papers studied the psychological and social influences in retirement saving decisions. Policy implications and future research are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper examines the degree to which Americans are saving optimally for retirement. Our standard for assessing optimality comes from a life-cycle model that incorporates uncertain lifetimes, uninsurable earnings and medical expenses, progressive taxation, government transfers, and pension and social security benefit functions derived from rich household data. We solve every household's decision problem from death to starting age and then use the decision rules in conjunction with earnings histories to make predictions about wealth in 1992. Ours is the first study to compare, household by household, wealth predictions that arise from a life-cycle model that incorporates earnings histories for a nationally representative sample. The results, based on data from the Health and Retirement Study, are striking we find that the model is capable of accounting for more than 80 percent of the 1992 cross-sectional variation in wealth. Fewer than 20 percent of households have less wealth than their optimal targets, and the wealth deficit of those who are undersaving is generally small.},

More specifically, the following research question is answered: To what extent are labour market outcomes of physicians explained by the skills acquired in education, as indicated in the theory of human capital, or by competences already present at the start of education, as suggested by the screening theory? The study uses separate measurements of competence at the start and at the end of education. Moreover, we use a direct measurement of competence development during medical education. This enables us to disentangle the effects of the suggested mechanisms. The results suggest that after graduation human capital factors do not explain subsequent differences in labour market outcomes. The medical degree seems a sufficient signal of screening device as such. However, selection processes during education take place on human capital acquired before and during medical education.},

@article{Epley2014,
abstract = {Connecting with others increases happiness, but strangers in close proximity routinely ignore each other. Why? Two reasons seem likely: Either solitude is a more positive experience than interacting with strangers, or people misunderstand the consequences of distant social connections. To examine the experience of connecting to strangers, we instructed commuters on trains and buses to connect with a stranger near them, to remain disconnected, or to commute as normal (Experiments 1a and 2a). In both contexts, participants reported a more positive (and no less productive) experience when they connected than when they did not. Separate participants in each context, however, expected precisely the opposite outcome, predicting a more positive experience in solitude (Experiments 1b and 2b). This mistaken preference for solitude stems partly from underestimating others' interest in connecting (Experiments 3a and 3b), which in turn keeps people from learning the actual consequences of social interaction (Experiments 4a and 4b). The pleasure of connection seems contagious: In a laboratory waiting room, participants who were talked to had equally positive experiences as those instructed to talk (Experiment 5). Human beings are social animals. Those who misunderstand the consequences of social interactions may not, in at least some contexts, be social enough for their own well-being.

over the business cycle and a 1962 Federal Court Order to desegregate
the university racially reduced donations but not significantly.
Given the 63-year cycle studied, the growth rates of alumni donations
of money are projected to decline after roughly age 52, which falls

The experiment randomized listeners into nine treatment groups, each of which received a different level of audio advertising interrupting their music listening, with the highest treatment group receiving more than twice as many ads as the lowest treatment group. By keeping consistent treatment assignment for 21 months, we can see that the long-term effects of a change in " ad load, " or number of ads per hour, take over a year to be fully realized. We estimate a demand curve that is strikingly linear, with the number of hours listened decreasing linearly in the number of ads per hour. We also show the negative impact on the number of days listened and on the probability of listening at all in the final month. Using an experimental design that separately varies the number of commercial interruptions per hour and the number of ads per commercial interruption, we find that neither makes any difference to listeners except for the way they increase the total number of ads per hour. Lastly, we find increased ad load causes a significant increase in the number of paid ad-free subscriptions to Pandora, particularly among older listeners.},

abstract = {Despite significant policy efforts to encourage Americans to save for retirement, the U.S. retirement savings rates have declined for more than two decades. Current policies and programs are largely driven by three implicit theories of why people do and do not save: trait theory, life cycle, and education. The authors' purpose is not to identify a singular best theory but rather to demonstrate the need to expand the theories used to address the retirement savings problem. Toward that end, they empirically examine each traditional theory and simultaneously explore the additional power of complementary theories: future-self theory and imagery. The results show that variables grounded in trait theory, life cycle, and education are significantly related to retirement planning. Moreover, people who reported greater and more vivid imagery of a positive future retired self had engaged in more retirement preparation, accounting for a significant amount of variance beyond the traditional theories.},

The control treatment is a standard public bad experiment, while in the leader treatments the design is such that in each group the leader decides first on his or her investment in the public bad. After being informed about the leader's decision, the four -{\"{A}}{\`{o}}followers' in each group make their investment decision. Two treatments of the leadership game are played with each group. In the same-leader-costs treatment, all subjects are confronted with the same costs, while in the no-leader-costs treatment the leader faces no direct costs of acting socially. It is found that followers invest significantly less in the public bad when there is a leader compared with a situation when there is no leader. Comparing the two treatments, we find, moreover, that the leadership effect is somewhat stronger when leaders face the same costs as followers compared with the situation in which leaders bear no costs. Randomly chosen leaders set an example by investing less than average players in a standard public bad game, and leader investments are lowest when the costs of leading are low.},

When it comes to foreign aid and international redistribution across racial lines, I argue that prejudice manifests not in an uncharitable, resentful way but in a paternalistic way because intergroup contact is minimal and because of how the media portray black foreigners. Using two survey experiments, I show that white Americans are more favorable toward aid when cued to think of foreign poor of African descent than when cued to think of those of East European descent. This relationship is due not to the greater perceived need of black foreigners but to an underlying racial paternalism that sees them as lacking in human agency. The findings confirm accusations of aid skeptics and hold implications for understanding the roots of paternalistic practices in the foreign aid regime.},

Our main result is that the mobility of young adults crucially depends on the presence of a sibling. Siblings compete in location and employment decisions to direct parental care decisions towards their preferred outcome. Only children are not exposed to this kind of competition. This causes an equilibrium in which siblings exhibit higher mobility than only children, and also have better labour market outcomes. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, we find evidence that confirms these patterns.},

abstract = {We report results from a field experiment in which a randomized subset of newly hired workers at a large financial institution received a flyer containing information about the employer's 401(k) plan and the value of contributions compounding over a career. Younger workers who received the flyer were significantly more likely to begin contributing to the plan relative to their peers in the control group. Many workers do not participate in their employers' supplemental retirement savings programs, even though these programs offer substantial tax advantages and immediate returns due to matching contributions. From a survey of new hires we find that many workers choose not to contribute to the plan because they have other financial priorities. However, some non-participants lack the financial literacy to appreciate the benefit. These findings indicate that simple informational interventions can nudge workers to participate in retirement saving plans and enhance individual well-being and retirement income security},

insights emerge; perhaps the most provocative is that age and social

@article{Hirshleifer1983a,
abstract = {Abstract It has traditionally been assumed that the socially available
amount X of a public good is the simple sum of the separate amounts
x i produced by the i = 1, ..., I members of the community. But there
are many other possibilities of practical importance. Among them
are: (i) Weakest-link rule, where the socially available amount is
the minimum of the quantities individually provided, and (ii) Best-shot
rule, where the socially available amount is the maximum of the individual
quantities. The former tends to arise in linear situations, where
each individual has a veto on the total to be provided (e.g., if
each is responsible for one link of a chain); the latter tends to
arise when there is a single prize of overwhelming importance for
the community, with any individual's effort having a chance of securing
the prize.

In comparison with the standard Summation formula of ordinary public-good
theory, it is shown that underprovision of the public good tends
to considerably moderated when the Weakest-link function is applicable,
but aggravated when the Best-shot function is applicable. In time
of disaster, where the survival of the community may depend upon
each person's doing his duty, the conditions for applicability of
the Weakest-link rule are approximated. This circumstance explains
the historical observation that disaster conditions tend to elicit
an extraordinary amount of unselfish behavior.},

I quantify how much the consumption decisions of individuals depend

the sales expectations held by profit-maximizing theatre owners.
Several pieces of evidence are consistent with social learning. First,
sales of movies with positive surprise and negative surprise in opening
weekend demand diverge over time. If a movie has better than expected
appeal and therefore experiences larger than expected sales in Week
1, consumers in Week 2 update upward their expectations of quality,
further increasing Week 2 sales. Second, this divergence is small
for movies for which consumers have strong priors and large for movies
for which consumers have weak priors. Third, the effect of a surprise
is stronger for audiences with large social networks. Finally, consumers
do not respond to surprises in first-week sales that are orthogonal
to movie quality, like weather shocks. Overall, social learning appears
to be an important determinant of sales in the movie industry, accounting

We find that interventions to improve financial literacy explain only 0.1{\%} of the variance in$\backslash$r$\backslash$nfinancial behaviors studied, with weaker effects in low-income samples. Like other education, financial$\backslash$r$\backslash$neducation decays over time; even large interventions with many hours of instruction have negligible$\backslash$r$\backslash$neffects on behavior 20 months or more from the time of intervention. Correlational studies that measure$\backslash$r$\backslash$nfinancial literacy find stronger associations with financial behaviors. We conduct three empirical studies,$\backslash$r$\backslash$nand we find that the partial effects of financial literacy diminish dramatically when one controls for$\backslash$r$\backslash$npsychological traits that have been omitted in prior research or when one uses an instrument for financial$\backslash$r$\backslash$nliteracy to control for omitted variables.

abstract = {We show that the vast majority of very high-achieving students who are low-income do not apply to any selective college or university. This is despite the fact that selective institutions would often cost them less, owing to generous financial aid, than the resource-poor two-year and non-selective four-year institutions to which they actually apply. Moreover, high-achieving, low-income students who do apply to selective institutions are admitted and graduate at high rates. We demonstrate that these low-income students' application behavior differs greatly from that of their high-income counterparts who have similar achievement. The latter group generally follows the advice to apply to a few "par" colleges, a few "reach" colleges, and a couple of "safety" schools. We separate the low-income, high-achieving students into those whose application behavior is similar to that of their high-income counterparts ("achievement-typical" behavior) and those whose apply to no selective institutions ("income-typical" behavior). We show that income-typical students do not come from families or neighborhoods that are more disadvantaged than those of achievement-typical students. However, in contrast to the achievement-typical students, the income-typical students come from districts too small to support selective public high schools, are not in a critical mass of fellow high achievers, and are unlikely to encounter a teacher or schoolmate from an older cohort who attended a selective college. We demonstrate that widely-used policies-college admissions staff recruiting, college campus visits, college access programs-are likely to be ineffective with income-typical students, and we suggest policies that will be effective must depend less on geographic concentration of high achievers.},

Investment preferences of survey respondents, estimated using the scale-adjusted version of a latent class choice model, also change during the crisis. We identify age and income as important determinants of preference classes in both surveys and age is also identified as a key determinant of variability (scale). Young and low income individuals make choices that are more consistent with standard mean-variance analysis, but older and higher income individuals react positively to both higher returns and increasing risk in returns.

abstract = {People are reciprocal if they reward kind actions and punish unkind ones. In this paper we present a formal theory of reciprocity. It takes into account that people evaluate the kindness of an action not only by its consequences but also by its underlying intention. The theory is in line with the relevant stylized facts of a wide range of experimental games, such as the ultimatum game, the gift-exchange game, a reduced best-shot game, the dictator game, the prisoner's dilemma, and public goods games. Furthermore, it predicts that identical consequences trigger different reciprocal responses in different environments. Finally, the theory explains why outcomes tend to be fair in bilateral interactions whereas extremely unfair distributions may arise in competitive markets.},

of mitigating circumstances. However, in all previous experiments,
there have been no costs to inclusion or benefits for ostracism.
If being included meant losing money and being ostracized meant retaining
money, would individuals still be distressed when ostracized? In
2 studies, the authors attempted to "load the dice" against inclusion
in favor of ostracism. Participants played a variant of Cyberball
called euroyberball (pronounced Euroball), in which ostracism and
inclusion were crossed with whether the participants earned or lost
money for each ball toss they received. In 2 experiments, the authors
found that even when being ostracized meant retaining more money
than the other players, it was painful. In Study 2, the authors also
introduced conditions in which participants were overincluded. In
these conditions, participants were sensitive to financial incentives.
However, even then participants felt worse when given no positive
attention than when given punitive attention.},

If donors in such an environment determine the sequence of moves, two contribution orders may arise as equilibria. Either the uninformed and informed donors contribute simultaneously or the informed contribute prior to the uninformed. Sequential moves result in a larger provision of the public good, because the follower mimics the action of the leader, and in accounting for this response the leader chooses to contribute when it is efficient to do so. An experimental investigation of the game shows that the donors predominantly choose to contribute sequentially, and that the resulting contributions are larger than those of the simultaneous-move game. Although the gain from sequential moves is smaller when the sequence is set exogenously, our results suggest that the involved parties would benefit from having sequential moves imposed upon them.},

Do people have a need to satisfy their demand for giving by contributing to a particular charity? Or can the demand for doing good be satisfied by giving to any organization? In a donation dictator game competition between charities is simulated by altering the set of similar real charities to which subjects can give. I find weak substitution between charities when giving to more than one charity is possible, as the donated amounts to individual charities decrease with the size of the choice set. At the same time, the sum of donations to all charities increases when charities are in competition. Additionally, a reduced price in giving to one charity (matching grant) increases giving to the matched charity. However, a match does not result in a complete shift of donations to this charity. Further, subjects substitute part of their own contributions with the matching grant and leave their individual total contributions unchanged.},

One explanation is that education appears to have a double effect on the earnings of women.

abstract = {A number of financial market analysts have argued that the aging of the "Baby Boom" cohort contributed to the rise U.S. asset values during the 1990s, and that asset prices will decline when this group reaches retirement age and begins to draw down its wealth. This paper explores the importance of changing demographic structure for asset returns, asset prices, and the composition of household balance sheets in the United States. Standard models suggest that equilibrium returns on financial assets will vary in response to changes in population age structure. While the direction of the effect of demographic changes is not controversial, the quantitative importance of such changes for financial markets is open to debate. The paper presents several strands of empirical evidence that bear on this issue. First, it describes current age-specific patterns of asset holding in the United States, and finds that asset holdings rise sharply when households are in their 30s and 40s. Aside from the automatic decline in the value of defined benefit pension assets as households age, however, other financial assets decline only gradually during retirement. When these data are used to project asset demands in light of the future age structure of the U.S. population, they do not show a sharp decline in asset demand between 2020 and 2050. This finding calls into question the "asset market meltdown" view. Second, the paper considers the historical association between population age structure and real returns on Treasury bills, long-term government bonds, and corporate stock. The evidence suggests only modest effects, if any, of a changing demographic mix. Statistical tests based on the few effective degrees of freedom in the historical record of age structure and asset returns have limited power to detect such effects. There is a stronger historical correlation between asset levels, as measured for example by the price-dividend ratio, and summary measures of the population age structure. Once again, however, the results are sensitive to choices about econometric specification. These empirical findings provide modest support, at best, for the view that asset prices could decline as the share of households over the age of 65 increases.},

The results suggest that no positive average earnings premium exists for metro area graduates after differences in students' pre-university characteristics are taken into account. However, the metro area university premium is found to be, to some extent, heterogeneous across fields and regional labour markets. The findings also indicate the importance of accounting for the selective nature of individuals' migration behaviour when conditioning on post-university region in the estimation of university location effects.},

of mitigating circumstances. However, in all previous experiments,
there have been no costs to inclusion or benefits for ostracism.
If being included meant losing money and being ostracized meant retaining
money, would individuals still be distressed when ostracized? In
2 studies, the authors attempted to "load the dice" against inclusion
in favor of ostracism. Participants played a variant of Cyberball
called euroyberball (pronounced Euroball), in which ostracism and
inclusion were crossed with whether the participants earned or lost
money for each ball toss they received. In 2 experiments, the authors
found that even when being ostracized meant retaining more money
than the other players, it was painful. In Study 2, the authors also
introduced conditions in which participants were overincluded. In
these conditions, participants were sensitive to financial incentives.
However, even then participants felt worse when given no positive
attention than when given punitive attention.},

discourage the performance of altruistic activities because they
conflict with intrinsic altruistic motivations. However, it is unclear
whether this is evidence of a generalized aversion to rewards or,
rather, an aversion to receiving specific material prizes, such as
cash. We conducted a randomized-controlled experiment, through a
survey administered to 467 blood donors in an Italian town, and found
that donors are not reluctant to receive compensation in general;
a substantial share of respondents declared that they would stop
being donors if given 10 Euros in cash, but we do not find such effects
when a voucher of the same nominal value is offered instead. The
aversion to direct cash payments is particularly marked among women,
but does not emerge among individuals who have only recently become
donors. All of our findings are robust to regression analyses. Implications
for research and public policy are discussed.},

Motivated by a model of conditional demand, I consider the extent to which a "temporary shock" that increases an individual's donation to one cause by a particular amount displaces her gifts to other charitable causes. I use the 2001-2007 waves of the PSID/COPPS, the first data set of its kind, to identify this. Households that give more to one type of charity tend to give more to others. However, many of the correlations between the residuals after fixed-effects regressions are negative and significant, particularly for larger donors and for certain categories of charitable giving. Given plausible econometric assumptions, the negative correlations are strong evidence of expenditure substitution. Overall, these results suggest heterogeneous motivations for giving: small givers may be mainly driven by temporary shocks and personal appeals while larger givers may have concave multi-charity warm-glow preferences.

straightforward, its logical implications are significantly different

For example, the contributions of other donors can reduce an impact
philanthropist's charitable

fulfillment. As a result, cooperation among impact philanthropists
can reduce aggregate giving. In

addition, impact philanthropy can lead to a codependent relationship
between givers and receivers in

which both benefit from the other. Finally, the model suggests a conflict
between charitable

organizations and its donors concerning the allocation of charitable
gifts. In particular, a charitable

organization prefers to spread a donor's contribution across many
goods, whereas a donor prefers to

target his or her contribution at a specific good.},

We find giving to the experimenter not to be significantly different from giving to a charity, when the amount the subject donates crowds out the amount donated by the experimenter such that the charity always receives a fixed amount. This result suggests that the latter treatment, first used by Crumpler and Grossman (J Public Econ 92(5-6):1011-1021, 2008), does not provide a clean test of warm glow motivation. We then propose a new method of detecting warm glow motivation based on the idea that in a random-lottery incentive (RLI) scheme, such as the one we employ, warm glow accumulates and this may lead to satiation, whereas purely altruistic motivation does not. We also provide bounds on the magnitudes of warm glow and pure altruism as motives that drive giving in our experiment.},

abstract = {Numerous studies regress log earnings on schooling and report estimated coefficients as `Mincer rates of return'. A more recent literature uses instrumental variables. This chapter considers the economic interpretation of these analyses and how the availability of repeated cross section and panel data improves the ability of analysts to estimate the rate of return. We consider under what conditions the Mincer model estimates an ex post rate of return. We test and reject the model on six cross sections of U.S. Census data. We present a general nonparametric approach for estimating marginal internal rates of return that takes into account tuition, income taxes and forms of uncertainty. We also contrast estimates based on a single cross-section of data, using the synthetic cohort approach, with estimates based on repeated cross-sections following actual cohorts. Cohort-based models fitted on repeated cross section data provide more reliable estimates of ex post returns. Accounting for uncertainty affects estimates of rates of return. Accounting for sequential revelation of information calls into question the validity of the internal rate of return as a tool for policy analysis. An alternative approach to computing economic rates of return that accounts for sequential revelation of information is proposed and the evidence is summarized. We distinguish ex ante from ex post returns. New panel data methods for estimating the uncertainty and psychic costs facing agents are reviewed. We report recent evidence that demonstrates that there are large psychic costs of schooling. This helps to explain why persons do not attend school even though the financial rewards for doing so are high. We present methods for computing distributions of returns ex ante and ex post. We review the literature on instrumental variable estimation. The link of the estimates to the economics is not strong. The traditional instruments are weak, and this literature has not produced decisive empirical estimates. We exposit new methods that interpret the economic content of different instruments within a unified framework.},

abstract = {We examine the effectiveness in field settings of seven healthy eating nudges, classified according to whether they influence 1) cognition, via -descriptive nutritional labeling,- -evaluative nutritional labeling,- or -salience enhancements-; 2) affect, via -hedonic or sensory cues- or -healthy eating prods-; or 3) behavior, via -convenience enhancements- or -plate and portion size changes.- Compared with existing univariate meta-analyses, our multivariate three-level meta-analysis of 277 effect sizes controlling for eating behavior, population, and study characteristics yields smaller effect sizes overall. These effect sizes increase as the focus of the intervention shifts from cognition (d=.08, equivalent to -45 kcal/day) to affect (d=.22, -121 kcal) to behavior (d=.35, -186 kcal). Interventions are more effective at reducing unhealthy eating than at increasing healthy eating or reducing total eating. Effect sizes are larger in the US than in other countries, in restaurants or cafeterias than in grocery stores, and in studies including a control group. Effect sizes are similar for food selection vs. consumption, for children vs. adults, and are independent of study duration. Compared to the typical study, one testing the best nudge scenario should expect a fourfold increase in effectiveness, with half due to switching from cognitive to behavioral nudges.},

We test hypotheses with conditional logistic regression analysis, using the Giving in the Netherlands Panel Study (Nhouseholds=1246; Norganizations=64). We found that providing people with the opportunity to give increases donations, while which people will donate is conditional on the type of request made. Furthermore, we found some support for the argument that organizations receive more donations from people that have specific incentives (social status motives, religious and political values) to donate to these organizations. Finally, only organizations striving for difficult goals receive more donations from people with higher levels of confidence. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

We study this question in the context of Germany between 1929 and 1939. Using geographical and temporal variation in radio availability, we show that radio had a significant negative effect on the Nazi electoral support between 1929 and 1932, when political news were slanted against Nazi party. This effect was reversed in just 5 weeks following Hitler's appointment as chancellor and the transfer of control of the radio to the Nazis. Pro-Nazi radio propaganda caused higher vote for the Nazis in March 1933 election. After full consolidation of power, radio propaganda helped the Nazis to enroll new party members and encouraged denunciations of Jews and other open expressions of anti-Semitism. The effect of Nazi propaganda was not uniform. Depending on listeners' priors about the message, propaganda could be very effective or could backfire. Nazi radio was most effective in places where anti-Semitism was historically high and had a negative effect on the support for anti-Semitic policies in places with historically low anti-Semitism.},

abstract = {A fast-growing market for meta-analytic software is R. Despite the pervasive availability of meta-analytic R packages, only a small number of publications have examined the abilities of these packages (Chen {\&} Pence, 2013; Neupane, Richer, Bonner, Kibret, {\&} Beyene, 2014), and no review to date has comprehensively cataloged each package. As such, the purpose of this project is to delineate the scope and breadth of meta-analytic R packages in order to: a) inform the meta-analytic field of the availability of these packages, b) explore the packages' power and applicability, c) elucidate future areas of greater package need. To answer these questions, we conducted a systematic review of meta-analytic R packages using various aggregators (e.g., CRAN website, Revolution Analytics, Crantastic). The search process yielded 136 potential packages of which 54 provided unique contributions (See online appendix). We coded specific capabilities of each package using a pre-defined codebook (See online appendix). Although the coding process is still ongoing, preliminary results indicated a plethora of traditional functionality (e.g., weighted average calculations, moderator analyses), but few packages for the review stage (i.e., screening or coding) or advanced analyses (i.e., multilevel modeling, graphics). The final results will be available prior to the June conference.},

abstract = {This paper examines an affirmative action program for "lower-caste" groups in engineering colleges in India. We study both the targeting properties of the program, and its implications for labor market outcomes. We find that affirmative action successfully targets the financially disadvantaged: the upper-caste applicants that are displaced by affirmative action come from a richer economic background than the lower-caste applicants that are displacing them. Targeting by caste, however, may lead to the exclusion of other disadvantaged groups. For example, caste-based targeting reduces the overall number of females entering engineering colleges. We find that despite poor entrance exam scores, lower-caste entrants obtain a positive return to admission. Our estimates, however, also suggest that these gains may come at an absolute cost because the income losses experienced by displaced upper-caste applicants are larger than the income gains experienced by displacing lower-caste students. Limited sample sizes in our preferred econometric specifications, however, prevent us from drawing strong conclusions from these labor market findings. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

regarded by others{\^{A}}- as a driver in prosocial behavior (doing good),
and asks whether extrinsic monetary incentives (doing well) have
a detrimental effect on prosocial behavior due to crowding out of
image motivation. By definition, image depends on one{\^{A}}'s behavior
being visible to other people. Using this unique property we show
that image is indeed an important part of the motivation to behave
prosocially. Moreover, we show that extrinsic incentives interact
with image motivation and are therefore less effective in public
than in private. Together, these results imply that image motivation
is crowded out by monetary incentives; this means that monetary incentives
are more likely to be counterproductive for public prosocial activities
than for private ones. JEL},

abstract = {We introduce emotions into an equilibrium notion. In a mental equilibrium
each player -selects- an emotional state which determines the player's
preferences over the outcomes of the game. These preferences typically
differ from the players' material preferences. The emotional states
interact to play a Nash equilibrium and in addition each player's
emotional state must be a best response (with respect to material
preferences) to the emotional states of the others. We first discuss
the concept behind the definition of mental equilibrium and show
that this behavioral equilibrium notion organizes quite well the
results of some of the most popular experiments in the literature
of experimental economics. We expose some attractive properties of
mental equilibria which are useful for deriving the set of mental
equilibria for specific games.},

Eligibility for matches is determined in entirely by observable attributes of the request, providing an exogenous source of variation in incentives to donate between charities.

We propose a model that allows the control and treatment groups to have different average benefits from the treatment. The assumptions of the proposed model are invariant to the scaling of the outcome. We provide conditions under which the model is nonparametrically identified and propose an estimator that can be applied using either repeated cross section or panel data. Our approach provides an estimate of the entire counterfactual distribution of outcomes that would have been experienced by the treatment group in the absence of the treatment and likewise for the untreated group in the presence of the treatment. Thus, it enables the evaluation of policy interventions according to criteria such as a mean-variance trade-off. We also propose methods for inference, showing that our estimator for the average treatment effect is root-N consistent and asymptotically normal. We consider extensions to allow for covariates, discrete dependent variables, and multiple groups and time periods.},

abstract = {The competition for donations between charities is tough. Yet, little is known about how people react to the extensive supply of charitable organizations. Do people have a need to satisfy their demand for giving by contributing to a particular charity? Or can the demand for doing good be satisfied by giving to any organization? In a donation dictator game competition between charities is simulated by altering the set of similar real charities to which subjects can give. I find weak substitution between charities when giving to more than one charity is possible, as the donated amounts to individual charities decrease with the size of the choice set. At the same time, the sum of donations to all charities increases when charities are in competition. Additionally, a reduced price in giving to one charity (matching grant) increases giving to the matched charity. However, a match does not result in a complete shift of donations to this charity. Further, subjects substitute part of their own contributions with the matching grant and leave their individual total contributions unchanged.},

abstract = {This paper presents novel empirical evidence on key predictions of
heterogeneous firm models by examining stock market reactions to
the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement of 1989 (CUSFTA). Using
the uncertainty surrounding the agreement's ratification, I show
that the pattern of abnormal returns of Canadian manufacturing firms
was broadly consistent with the predictions of a class of models
based on Melitz (2003). Increases in the likelihood of ratification
led to stock market gains of exporting firms relative to non-exporters.
Moreover, gains were higher in sectors with larger cuts in U.S. import
tariffs. Decreases in the likelihood of ratification led to opposite
stock market reactions. Results for the impact of Canadian tariff
reductions are less conclusive but most specifications suggest that
exporters also gained relative to non-exporters in response to such
reductions. Translating stock market gains into implied profit changes,
I find that CUSFTA increased expected per-period profits of exporters

abstract = {Social influences have been widely recorded in charitable giving. In two field experiments, we attempt to exogenously manipulate sources of social influence in the workplace. This environment allows the use of administrative data to map participants' hierarchies in a network, and their approximate proximity to each-other socially. In our first experiment, participants are sent an email by the CEO asking them to donate a day's salary to charity. When this email is personalised, being addressed to -Dear John- rather than -Dear Colleague-, donations significantly increase. In the second experiment, we provide some participants with information about the proportion of their colleagues who have already donated. In this case, the social norm is not to donate (only 7.5{\%} have donated). We find no negative effects of this information on future donations, and that for some, high-ranking groups, the effect is (perhaps counterintuitively) positive. We suggest that relationships within the workplace - a concern for status relative to the CEO, or for the firm's reputation - may explain these results.},

abstract = {This paper presents evidence from a large-scale field experiment on conditional cooperation: people behave pro-socially depending on the pro-social behavior of other persons. When students were presented with the information that many others donated to two charitable funds at the University of Zurich in Switzerland, their willingness to contribute increased. This constitutes a first test of social interaction effects in charitable giving in a field experiment. The behavior resulting from conditional cooperation is consistent with at least three theoretical approaches: first, people may want to behave in an appropriate way and to conform to a social norm; second, people have some level of fairness preferences, such as reciprocity; or third, contributions by others may serve as a signal of the quality of the public good, or of the organization that provides the good. Results from previous experiments that attempt to discriminate among the various explanations are ambiguous. Some experimental studies indicate that conformity can explain conditional cooperation better than reciprocal considerations, while others come to the opposite conclusion. Yet other laboratory experiments find evidence supporting the third mechanism, that cooperative behavior of others is used as an indication of the quality of the public good.},

We find that the labor market opportunities and family ties of both partners affect these location choices. Surprisingly, married men live significantly closer to their own parents than do married women, even if they have children, and this difference cannot be explained by differences in observed characteristics. The principal source of excess female distance from parents in this population is the relatively low mobility of men without a college degree, particularly in rural areas. Despite evidence that intergenerational resource flows, such as childcare and eldercare, are particularly important between women and their parents, the family connections of husbands appear to dominate the location decisions of less-educated married couples.

The reason, that reservation values were unobtainable, may no longer be true now that massive datasets tracking detailed individual behavior exist. Hence, a fundamental change in the way goods are priced may be underway. I investigate this claim in one context. I show demographics, which in the past could be used to personalize prices, poorly predict which consumers subscribe to Netflix. By contrast, modern web- browsing data, with variables such as visits to Amazon.com and internet use on Tuesdays - variables which reflect behavior - do substantially better. I then present a model to estimate demand and simulate outcomes had 1st degree PD been implemented. The model is structural, derived from canonical theory models, but resembles an ordered Probit, allowing a new method for handling massive datasets and addressing overfitting and high dimensionality. Simulations show using demographics alone to tailor prices raises profits by 0.8{\%}. Including nearly 5000 potential website browsing explanatory variables increases profits by much more, 12.2{\%}, increasingly the appeal of tailored pricing, and resulting in some consumers paying double the price others do for the exact same product. Implications for the overall economy and its structure are discussed. (JEL: D42, L130)},

However, the explanation for this is unclear. An individual may want to send a signal of her generosity to improve her own reputation. Alternately (or additionally) she may value the public good or charity itself and, believing that contribution levels are strategic complements, give more to influence others to give more. We perform the first series of laboratory experiments that can separately estimate the impact of these two social effects, and test whether realized influence is consistent with the desire to influence, and whether either of these are consistent with anticipated influence. Our experimental subjects were given the opportunity to contribute from their endowment to Bread for the World, a development NGO. Depending on treatment, "leader" subjects' donations were reported to other subjects either anonymously or with their identities, and these were reported either before these "follower" subjects made their donation decisions. We find that "leaders" are influential only when their identities are revealed along with their donations, and female leaders are more influential than males. Identified leaders' predictions suggest that are aware of their influence. They respond to this by giving more than either the control group or the unidentified leaders. We find mixed evidence for "reputation-seeking."},

This effect was reversed in just 5 weeks following Hitler's appointment as chancellor and the transfer of control of the radio to the Nazis. Pro-Nazi radio propaganda caused higher vote for the Nazis in March 1933 election. After full consolidation of power, radio propaganda helped the Nazis to enroll new party members and encouraged denunciations of Jews and other open expressions of anti-Semitism. The effect of Nazi propaganda was not uniform. Depending on listeners' priors about the message, propaganda could be very effective or could backfire. Nazi radio was most effective in places where anti- Semitism was historically high and had a negative effect on the support for anti-Semitic policies in places with historically low anti-Semitism},

norms concerning when offers can be made, accepted and rejected.
Examining a dozen previously studied markets suggests that markets
in which transactions are made far in advance are markets in which
it is acceptable for firms to make exploding offers, and unacceptable
for workers to renege on commitments they make, however early. But
this evidence is only suggestive, because the markets differ in many
ways other than norms concerning offers. Laboratory experiments allow
us to isolate the effects of exploding offers and binding acceptances.
In a simple environment, in which uncertainty about applicants' quality
is resolved over time, we find inefficient early contracting when
firms can make exploding offers and applicants' acceptances are binding.
Relaxing either of these two conditions causes matching to take place
later, when more information about applicants' qualities is available,
and consequently results in higher efficiency and fewer blocking
pairs. This suggests that elements of market culture may play an
important role in influencing market performance.},

assuming that they are shaped by the attitudes of parents and other

to children; (2) an impact of prevailing attitudes in the local environment
on child attitudes; and (3) positive assortative mating of parents,
which enhances the ability of a parent to pass on his or her attitudes
to the child. We focus on two fundamentally important attitudes,
willingness to take risks and willingness to trust others. We find
empirical support for all three aspects, providing an empirical underpinning
for the literature. An investigation of underlying mechanisms shows
that socialization is important in the transmission process. Various
parental characteristics and aspects of family structure are found
to strengthen the socialization process, with implications for modeling
the socialization production function and for policies focused on
affecting children's non-cognitive skills. The paper also provides
evidence that the transmission of risk and trust attitudes affects
a wide variety of child outcomes, implying a potentially large total

abstract = {This paper uses competitive equilibrium theory to analyze the economic
efficiency of international "fair trade" between ethical consumers
and low-income producers. The main analytical innovations are the
reconsideration of the labor supply decision in a state of Keynesian
involuntary unemployment as a choice between work and, not leisure,
but inferior production activities; and the application of Pigou
and Robinson's theory of employer monopsony, leading to a focus on
the "local fair trade organization", which has a similar effect to
a labor union or minimum wage in eliminating monopsony rents. A price
premium is found neither necessary nor sufficient for fair trade,
and in a state of involuntary unemployment a premium does not lead
to inefficient allocation. The conclusion is that fair trade improves
welfare by strengthening competition for labor, and should be encouraged
as a complementary element of an enlightened trade liberalization
policy.},

abstract = {In 6 studies, the authors tested whether the effect of mood on self-control
success depends on a person's

accessible goal. We propose that positive mood signals a person to
adopt an accessible goal, whereas

negative mood signals a person to reject an accessible goal; therefore,
if a self-improvement goal is

accessible, happy (vs. neutral or unhappy) people perform better on
self-control tasks that further that

goal. Conversely, if a mood management goal is accessible, happy people
abstain from self-control tasks

because the tasks are incompatible with this goal. This pattern receives
consistent support across several

self-control tasks, including donating to charity, demonstrating physical
endurance, seeking negative

feedback, and completing tests.


Note (JEPR): "Fishbach and Labroo (2007) find that the effect of a
positive mood on charitable giving is stronger when a participant
is primed to think about long-term goals since giving to a charity
'serves the long-term goal of helping a charity campaign and the
donor become a better perso'n"},

When this is not the case, commodity taxation is a tool that allows the government to expand its taxation power and is therefore desirable. This can happen either when the government uses social weights correlated with consumption patterns even conditioning on income or when patterns of consumption are related to intrinsic earning power or leisure choices. In that latter case, the desirability of commodity taxation hinges not on whether the commodity is consumed disproportionately by high earners but rather on whether individual demand for that good is less elastic than the cross-sectional demand pattern. ...},

abstract = {he major purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of three verbally-mediated variables on financial contributions in a door-todoor charity campaign. The relationship of race to contributions was also observed by using both black and white subjects. One hundred and twenty black and 120 white subjects were randomly assigned to one of 8 verbal appeals in a 2 (High vs. Low Dependency) - 2 (Internal vs. External Causal Locus of Need) - 2 (-it is your social responsibility- vs. -it will make you feel good- Expressed Reason for Giving) factorial design. The solicitor controlled for order effects by varying the sequence of these three variables within each experimental group. Main effects were found for Rae, Causal Locus of Need, and Expressed Reason for Giving: Whites contributed more than blacks, the external locus of need condition produced more giving than the internal condition, and persons who heard the -feel good- reason donated more than those in the -social responsibility- condition. Additionally, a significant Causal Locus of Need - Expressed Reason for Giving interaction was found. The combination of external locus of need and -feel good- was considerably more productive of contributions than the other three combinations. Implications of these results for the helping behavior literature are discussed.},

abstract = {We estimate the monetary return to attending a highly selective college
using the College and Beyond (C{\&}B) Survey linked to Detailed Earnings
Records from the Social Security Administration (SSA). This paper
extends earlier work by Dale and Krueger (2002) that examined the
relationship between the college that students attended in 1976 and
the earnings they self-reported reported in 1995 on the C{\&}B follow-up
survey. In this analysis, we use administrative earnings data to
estimate the return to various measures of college selectivity for
a more recent cohort of students: those who entered college in 1989.
We also estimate the return to college selectivity for the 1976 cohort
of students, but over a longer time horizon (from 1983 through 2007)
using administrative data.


We find that the return to college selectivity is sizeable for both
cohorts in regression models that control for variables commonly
observed by researchers, such as student high school GPA and SAT
scores. However, when we adjust for unobserved student ability by
controlling for the average SAT score of the colleges that students
applied to, our estimates of the return to college selectivity fall
substantially and are generally indistinguishable from zero. There
were notable exceptions for certain subgroups. For black and Hispanic
students and for students who come from less-educated families (in
terms of their parents' education), the estimates of the return to
college selectivity remain large, even in models that adjust for
unobserved student characteristics.},

The general conclusion drawn from this work is that women will be more socially-orientated (selfless), and men more individually-orientated (selfish). This paper reports the results of a double-anonymous dictator experiment designed to permit the emergence of basic gender differences in economic behaviour. Our results are intended to provide a baseline for further research. We find that women, on average, donate twice as much as men to their anonymous partners when any factors that might confound cooperation are eliminated.},

be least for an SCF of the weakest-link type but greatest for the

confirmed theoretical anticipations under all three types of SCF.

to others in 2 experiments. The studies were conducted in divergent
locations of a large eastern city, and Ss differed in ethnic and
socioeconomic characteristics. As in the earlier investigation, "good
mood" was induced by the discovery of a dime in the coin return of
a public telephone. The dependent measure in the present experiments,
however, was willingness to mail a sealed and addressed letter which
had been left at the telephone, apparently by accident. Both stamped
and unstamped letters were used. Results support the prediction that
those finding a dime would be more helpful, even though all Ss saw
the letter and even though the help did not involve interpersonal
interaction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Although university graduates are particularly mobile, we find that most of them do not move from their region of studies within 10 years after graduation. The out-migration, i.e., brain drain, is much higher among graduates in the more peripheral universities than in the growth centers (Helsinki in particular). Migration is also substantially more likely for those studying away from the home region than for those studying at home.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to: (i) analyse whether students admitted to one medical school based on top pre-university grades, a voluntary multifaceted selection process, or lottery, respectively, differed in study performance; (ii) examine whether students who were accepted in the multifaceted selection process outperformed their rejected peers, and (iii) analyse whether participation in the multifaceted selection procedure was related to performance.: We examined knowledge test and professionalism scores, study progress and dropout in three cohorts of medical students admitted to the University of Groningen, the Netherlands in 2009, 2010 and 2011 (n = 1055). We divided the lottery-admitted group into, respectively, students who had not participated and students who had been rejected in the multifaceted selection process. We used ancova modelling, logistic regression and Bonferroni post hoc multiple-comparison tests and controlled for gender and cohort.: The top pre-university grade group achieved higher knowledge test scores and more Year 1 course credits than all other groups (p  0.05). This group received the highest possible professionalism score more often than the lottery-admitted group that had not participated in the multifaceted selection process (p  0.05). The group of students accepted in the multifaceted selection process obtained higher written test scores than the lottery-admitted group that had not participated (p  0.05) and achieved the highest possible professionalism score more often than both lottery-admitted groups. The lottery-admitted group that had not participated in the multifaceted selection process earned fewer Year 1 and 2 course credits than all other groups (p  0.05). Dropout rates differed among the groups (p  0.05), but correction for multiple comparisons rendered all pairwise differences non-significant.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: A top pre-university grade point average was the best predictor of performance. For so-called non-academic performance, the multifaceted selection process was efficient in identifying applicants with suitable skills. Participation in the multifaceted selection procedure seems to be predictive of higher performance. Further research is needed to assess whether our results are generalisable to other medical schools.},

To account for the endogeneity of schooling, we apply three commonly used identification strategies. Our estimates demonstrate a strong life-cycle bias, often exceeding the bias from assuming that schooling is exogenous. We further explore the problems caused by life-cycle bias in research on the economic returns to schooling, and discuss possible remedies.},

They find that the attractiveness of a risky asset depends upon investors' time horizon: consistently with MLA, individuals are more willing to take risks when they evaluate their investments less frequently. This paper shows that these experimental findings can be accommodated by a standard version of Expected Utility Theory, namely a CRRA functional, provided that, consistently with MLA, we impose narrow bracketing. We use four different datasets to estimate two CRRA and two MLA functionals, together with binary mixture models of all combinations of the competing models. Our econometric exercise supports our theoretical claim on narrow bracketing and finds little evidence of subjects' loss aversion.

abstract = {Suppose that an experimenter has collected a sample as well as baseline information about the units in the sample. How should she allocate treatments to the units in this sample? We argue that the answer does not involve randomization if we think of experimental design as a statistical decision problem. If, for instance, the experimenter is interested in estimating the average treatment effect and evaluates an estimate in terms of the squared error, then she should minimize the expected mean squared error (MSE) through choice of a treatment assignment. We provide explicit expressions for the expected MSE that lead to easily implementable procedures for experimental design.},

abstract = {Many people fail to save what they will need for retirement. Research on excessive discounting of the future suggests that removing the lure of immediate rewards by precommitting to decisions or elaborating the value of future rewards both can make decisions more future oriented. The authors explore a third and complementary route, one that deals not with present and future rewards but with present and future selves. In line with research that shows that people may fail, because of a lack of belief or imagination, to identify with their future selves, the authors propose that allowing people to interact with age-progressed renderings of themselves will cause them to allocate more resources to the future. In four studies, participants interacted with realistic computer renderings of their future selves using immersive virtual reality hardware and interactive decision aids. In all cases, those who interacted with their virtual future selves exhibited an increased tendency to accept later monetary rewards over immediate ones.

With regard to research directed instead at estimating causal effects, we discuss three distinct weighting motives: (1) to achieve precise estimates by correcting for heteroskedasticity; (2) to achieve consistent estimates by correcting for endogenous sampling; and (3) to identify average partial effects in the presence of unmodeled heterogeneity of effects. In each case, we find that the motive sometimes does not apply in situations where practitioners often assume it does.},

abstract = {Consumers have shown a willingness to pay a premium for products labeled as -FT- and a preference for retailers that are seen to be more generous to their suppliers/employees. A FT product is essentially a bundle of a base product and a donation to the supplier (e.g., a coffee farmer). An altruistic rational consumer will only choose this bundle if doing so is less expensive than buying the base product and making a direct donation. For FT to be sustainable either in a competitive equilibrium or in a monopolistic environment this bundling must yield an efficiency. This efficiency is generated in the following context. A supplier's investment reduces the retailer's cost or boosts the final product's quality, but this investment is not immediately observable and cannot be enforced, hence there exists a moral hazard problem. In this environment, the altruism of the consumer can facilitate a more efficient contract: by paying the supplier more the retailer can both extract more consumer surplus and increase the level of contracted investment, while preserving the supplier's incentive compatibility constraint. We assess our model in the context of the coffee industry.},

power deconcentration in producing countries. It is hypothesised that

abstract = {Some social institutions reveal participants' behavior in the aggregate, while concealing the identities of the participants. For example, individual church donations may be kept anonymous, while the total amount raised is publicized. This presents a puzzle in light of recent evidence that anonymity reduces contributions. We offer an explanation for this puzzle in the context of a model of costly signaling with two types of agents: conditionally cooperative (" good" ) and uncooperative (" bad" ). We consider costly participation in a community activity (e.g., tithing) as a signal of an individual's type. By signaling the presence of one more good type, this may lead other good types to contribute more in future, more important, collective goods problems (CGP's). Thus, if good types also value others' contributions more than bad types, good types gain more from sending the signal. But if those who do not signal face exclusion, the signal would need to be made very costly to dissuade bad types from signaling. In contrast, if the institution is anonymous, so that it reveals only the total number of signals, then while signals cannot be used to exclude bad types, even an inexpensive signal may succeed in revealing the total number of good types. This informationhelps good types maximize the conditional cooperation component of their utility in the CGP, and under specified conditions, can increase expected CGP contributions. We characterize conditions under which an anonymous signaling institution increases expected welfare. We provide examples of institutions that may yield such benefits, including religion, music and dance, voting, charitable donations, and military traditions. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The research in Psychology and Economics (a.k.a. Behavioral Economics) suggests that individuals deviate from the standard model in three respects: (1) nonstandard preferences, (2) nonstandard beliefs, and (3) nonstandard decision making. In, this paper, I survey the empirical evidence from the field on these three classes of deviations. The evidence covers a number of applications, from consumption to finance, from crime to voting, from charitable giving to labor supply. In the class of nonstandard preferences, I discuss time preferences (self-control problems), risk preferences (reference dependence), and social preferences. On nonstandard beliefs, I present evidence on over-confidence, on the law of small numbers, and on projection bias. Regarding nonstandard decision, making, I cover framing, limited attention, menu effects, persuasion and social pressure, and emotions. I also present evidence on how rational actors-firms, employers, CEOs, investors, and politicians-respond to the nonstandard behavior described in, the survey. Finally, I briefly discuss under what conditions experience and,market interactions limit the impact of the nonstandard features.},

@article{Kahneman1979,
abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 1979 The Econometric Society},

Although humanitarian need appears to be a major determinant of emergency relief payments, our results suggest that political and strategic factors play a crucial role in emergency aid allocation as well.

We also test and reject the independence of donors' aid decisions, finding strong evidence for bandwagon effects in humanitarian assistance.},

is primarily responsible for giving decisions. Looking first at single-person
households, we find men and women to have significantly different
tastes for giving, setting up a potential conflict for married couples.
We find that, with respect to total giving, married households tend
to resolve these conflicts largely in favor of the husband's preferences.
Bargaining over charitable giving, rather than letting one spouse
take charge, is estimated to reduce giving by at least 6 percent.
When the woman is the decisionmaker, she will still make a significantly
different allocation of those charity dollars, preferring to give
to more charities but to give less to each. Our results give new
insights into both the demographics of charitable giving and the
costliness of household bargaining.},

Others argue that community and neighbourhood contacts are still important, for example, as a source of social support. According to Mollenhorst and colleagues, neighbours became more important in Dutch personal networks between 2000 and 2007. I assess how this developed between 2007-2008 and 2013. Next-door neighbours have (again) become more important. Neighbours are predominantly mentioned as associates who are visited and, increasingly, as associates who are asked for practical help. In contrast to Mollenhorst and colleagues, I find that the extent to which the Dutch like and trust neighbours in their network increased while contact frequency (further) declined. For highly educated residents, people without paid work, homeowners, and people with initially small local networks, the size of neighbour networks increased.},

Failing to control for valid covariates can yield biased parameter estimates in correlational analyses or in imperfectly randomized experiments and contributes to underpowered analyses even in effectively randomized experiments. We introduce double-lasso regression as a principle method for variable selection. The double lasso method is calibrated to not over-select potentially spurious covariates, and simulations demonstrate that using this method reduces error and increases statistical power. This method can be used to identify which covariates have sufficient empirical support for inclusion in analyses of correlations, moderation, mediation and experimental interventions, as well as to test for the effectiveness of randomization. We illustrate both the method's usefulness and how to implement it in practice by applying it to four analyses from the prior literature, using both correlational and experimental data.},

Applying the model to consumer behavior, we show that willingness to pay for a good is increasing in the expected probability of purchase and in the expected prices conditional on purchase.

This paper compares alternative procedures to deal with multiple measurements through the analysis of synthetic data sets in a Monte Carlo Study and a re-analysis of a published marketing data set. We show that the choice of procedure to deal with multiple measurements is by no means trivial and that it has implications for the results and for the validity of the generalizations derived from meta-analyses. Procedures that use the complete set of measurements outperform procedures that represent each study by a single value, The commonly used method of treating all measurements as independent performs reasonably well but is not preferable. We show that the optimal procedure to account for multiple measurements in meta-analysis explicitly deals with the nested error structure, i.e., at the measurement level and at the study level, which has not been practiced before in marketing meta-analyses.},

On average, donor governments favor smaller, geographically closer and oil exporting countries, and display significant biases in favor of politically less aligned countries as well as toward their former colonies. We also test and reject the independence of donors' aid decisions, finding strong evidence for bandwagon effects in humanitarian assistance.},

Governmental bodies, think tanks, and corporations around the world employ teams of experimental researchers to answer their most pressing questions. For their part, in the past two decades academics have begun to more actively partner with organizations to generate data via field experimentation. While this revolution in evidence- based approaches has served to deepen the economic science, recently a credibility crisis has caused even the most ardent experimental proponents to pause. This study takes a step back from the burgeoning experimental literature and introduces 12 actions that might help to alleviate this credibility crisis and raise experimental economics to an even higher level. In this way, we view our -12 action wish list- as discussion points to enrich the field. Eszter},

abstract = {Abstract:

Although economists have long been aware of Jensen's inequality, many
econometric applications have neglected an important implication
of it: the standard practice of interpreting the parameters of log-linearized
models estimated by ordinary least squares as elasticities can be
highly misleading in the presence of heteroskedasticity. This paper
explains why this problem arises and proposes an appropriate estimator.
Our criticism of conventional practices and the solution we propose
extends to a broad range of economic applications where the equation
under study is log-linearized. We develop the argument using one
particular illustration, the gravity equation for trade, and apply
the proposed technique to provide new estimates of this equation.
We find significant differences between estimates obtained with the
proposed estimator and those obtained with the traditional method.},

We introduce several treatments in which subjects are able to leave the relationship between their actions and resulting outcomes uncertain, either to themselves or to another subject influenced by those actions, thus giving subjects the moral -wiggle room- to behave self-interestedly. We find significantly less generous behavior in these manipulations, relative to a baseline in which the relationship between actions and outcomes is transparent. We conclude that many subjects behave fairly in the baseline case mainly because they intrinsically dislike appearing unfair, either to themselves or others.},

to reciprocate trust while at the same time competing for bonuses

within dyads including direct competitors, but also between individuals
who do not compete against each other. We test this idea in a trust
game where trustors and trustees are rewarded based either on their
absolute performance or on how well they do relative to players from
other dyads. In Experiment 1, we show that competition among trustors
significantly increases trust. Competition among trustees decreases
trustworthiness, but trustors do not anticipate this effect. In Experiment
2, we additionally show that the increase in trust under competition
is caused by a combination of increased risk taking and lower sensitivity
to non-financial concerns specific to trust interactions. Our results
suggest that tournament incentives might have a -blinding effect-
on considerations such as betrayal and inequality aversion.},

And now it has been completely rewritten and updated.You are told about the various levels of reading and how to achieve them -- from elementary reading, through systematic skimming and inspectional reading, to speed reading, you learn how to pigeonhole a book, X-ray it, extract the author's message, criticize. You are taught the different reading techniques for reading practical books, imaginative literature, plays, poetry, history, science and mathematics, philosophy and social science.Finally, the authors offer a recommended reading list and supply reading tests whereby you can measure your own progress in reading skills, comprehension and speed.},

Using data from up to 22 years after the lottery, we find that in every single year after graduation doctors earn at least 20 percent more than people who end up in their next-best occupation. Twenty-two years after the lottery the earnings difference is almost 50 percent. Only a small fraction of this difference can be attributed to differences in working hours and human capital investments. The returns do not vary with gender or ability, and shift the entire earnings distribution. (JEL D44, I11, I26, J24, J31, J44)},

abstract = {Dozens of markets of all types are in the early stages of a revolution
as the Internet and related technologies vastly expand the variety
of products that can be produced, promoted and purchased. Although
this revolution is based on a simple set of economic and technological
drivers, the authors argue that its implications are far-reaching
for managers, consumers and the economy as a whole. This article
looks at what has been dubbed the "Long Tail" phenomenon, examining
how customers derive value from an important characteristic of Internet
markets: the ability of online merchants to help consumers locate,
evaluate and purchase a far wider range of products than they can
typically buy via the traditional brick-and-mortar channels.


The article examines the Long Tail from both the supply side and the
demand side and identifies several key drivers. On the supply side,
the authors point out how e-tailers' expanded, centralized warehousing
allows for more offerings, thus making it possible for them to cater
to more varied tastes. On the demand side, tools such as search engines,
recommender software and sampling tools are allowing customers to
find products outside of their geographic area. The authors also
look toward the future to discuss second order amplified effects
of Long Tail, including the growth of markets serving smaller niches.},

abstract = {Previous experimental and observational work suggests that people act more generously when they are observed and observe others in social settings. However, the explanation for this is unclear. An individual may want to send a signal of her generosity to improve her own reputation. Alternately (or additionally) she may value the public good or charity itself and, believing that contribution levels are strategic complements, give more to influence others to give more. We perform the first series of laboratory experiments that can separately estimate the impact of these two social effects, and test whether realized influence is consistent with the desire to influence, and whether either of these are consistent with anticipated influence. Our experimental subjects were given the opportunity to contribute from their endowment to Bread for the World, a development NGO. Depending on treatment, "leader" subjects' donations were reported to other subjects either anonymously or with their identities, and these were reported either before these "follower" subjects made their donation decisions. We find that "leaders" are influential only when their identities are revealed along with their donations, and female leaders are more influential than males. Identified leaders' predictions suggest that are aware of their influence. They respond to this by giving more than either the control group or the unidentified leaders.We find mixed evidence for "reputation-seeking." {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2011.},

It will be analysed both thechoice made before enrolling at university and that one made after obtaining adegree. Data drawing from the last sample survey on employment conditions ofthe Italian students graduated in 2004 three years after obtaining their degree(2007), led by the Italian National Statistics Institute (ISTAT), will be used. Twoindices - one for research quality and the other one for teaching quality - willbe used as indicators of university quality, developed by using the results of thefirst government evaluation of Italian university research carried out by the InterministerialCommittee for Research Evaluation (2007). The results confirmthat the quality of university teaching and research significantly influence migrationmovements of Italian students. Furthermore, since most students tend to remainin the province where they carried out their university studies, after theirdegree, the results show that the basic choice for accumulating human capital--in loco-- - which could be the subject of appropriate policies - is that madewhen choosing the university. It is from this point of view that --university quality-- represents a potential instrument of --intervention-- in order to counterbalancethe negative effects of brain drain on the accumulation of human capital inthe regions where migration flows originate.},

abstract = {To understand the -pure- incentives of altruism, economic laboratory
research on humans almost always forbids communication between subjects.
In reality, however, altruism usually requires interaction between
givers and receivers, which clearly must influence choices. Charities,
for example, speak of the -power of asking.- Indeed, evolutionary
theories of altruism are built on human sociality. We experimentally
examine communication in which one subject allocates 10 between
herself and a receiver, and systematically altered who in the pair
could speak. We found that any time the recipient spoke, giving increased
- asking is powerful. But when only allocators could speak, choices
were significantly more selfish than any other condition. When empathy
was heightened by putting allocators -in the receiver's shoes,- giving
appeared as if recipients had been able to ask, even when they were
silent. We conclude that communication dramatically influences altruistic
behavior, and appears to largely work by heightening empathy.},

Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47{\%} of original effect sizes were in the 95{\%} confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39{\%} of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68{\%} with statistically significant effects.

abstract = {Social influences have been widely recorded in charitable giving. In two field experiments, we attempt to exogenously manipulate sources of social influence in the workplace. This environment allows the use of administrative data to map participants' hierarchies in a network, and their approximate proximity to each-other socially. In our first experiment, participants are sent an email by the CEO asking them to donate a day's salary to charity. When this email is personalised, being addressed to -Dear John- rather than -Dear Colleague-, donations significantly increase. In the second experiment, we provide some participants with information about the proportion of their colleagues who have already donated. In this case, the social norm is not to donate (only 7.5{\%} have donated). We find no negative effects of this information on future donations, and that for some, high-ranking groups, the effect is (perhaps counterintuitively) positive. We suggest that relationships within the workplace-a concern for status relative to the CEO, or for the firm's reputation-may explain these results.},

abstract = {Demographic changes, tight public budgets, and reduced generosity of occupational pension plans shift the responsibility for an adequate retirement provision towards the individual. Applying the theoretical perspectives of Behavioural Finance and New Institutionalism to the domain of retirement provision offers insights into the difficulties individuals are facing in planning for retirement, carrying out, and revising plans. Lacking financial literacy seems to lie at the heart of the problem and points to a possible solution: providing financial education to consumers through non-governmental organizations and state-related agencies. This article is examining which role consumer education and consumer advice can play to enhance financial literacy with regard to pensions and old-age provision. As two case studies Germany and the UK are compared because the institutional set-up of the pension systems and the approaches towards consumer policy are very different. The case studies show that financial education with regard to old-age provision can be successful if it reaches consumers in their environment at life-stages where important decisions need to be made. To achieve that considerable efforts have to be taken in terms of funding and organizational set-up. However, evaluation is necessary to prove the effectiveness of the education especially for vulnerable consumer groups. If evaluation reveals that these groups cannot be targeted effectively or that consumers are not taking action subsequently to attending financial education, there might be a case for changing behaviour through the institutional set-up of pension schemes (i.e., through automatic enrollment) and using financial education as a supportive policy instrument.},

research on humans almost always forbids communication between subjects.
In reality, however, altruism usually requires interaction between
givers and receivers, which clearly must influence choices. Charities,
for example, speak of the -power of asking.- Indeed, evolutionary
theories of altruism are built on human sociality. We experimentally
examine communication in which one subject allocates 10 between
herself and a receiver, and systematically altered who in the pair
could speak. We found that any time the recipient spoke, giving increased
- asking is powerful. But when only allocators could speak, choices
were significantly more selfish than any other condition. When empathy
was heightened by putting allocators -in the receiver's shoes,- giving
appeared as if recipients had been able to ask, even when they were
silent. We conclude that communication dramatically influences altruistic
behavior, and appears to largely work by heightening empathy.},

While that motive is straightforward, its logical implications are significantly different from other models of philanthropy. For example, the contributions of other donors can reduce an impact philanthropist's charitable fulfillment. As a result, cooperation among impact philanthropists can reduce aggregate giving. In addition, impact philanthropy can lead to a codependent relationship between givers and receivers in which both benefit from the other. Finally, the model suggests a conflict between charitable organizations and its donors concerning the allocation of charitable gifts. In particular, a charitable organization prefers to spread a donor's contribution across many goods, whereas a donor prefers to target his or her contribution at a specific good.},

However, it is not clear how research has addressed this issue and how much is know about retirement saving decisions. With this paper, we provided two major contributions to the literature on retirement saving. As a starting point, we developed a general chart of retirement saving choices, extending the work of Hurd and Panis (2006). These authors focused exclusively on choices at job change or retirement age and we extended their diagram to all main decisions at each stage of retirement saving, providing a more comprehensive framework. We then used this diagram as the yardstick to perform the systematic review and evaluate the breadth of research in the last 20 years. We found 130 papers and identified the most studied retirement choices and the under- researched areas. Most papers focused on asset allocation, decision to save and contribution rate. Less attention was given to decisions at retirement age and voluntary savings. Furthermore, very few papers studied the psychological and social influences in retirement saving decisions. Policy implications and future research are discussed.},

A laboratory experiment testing this solution confirms that donations decrease when overhead increases, but only when donors pay for overhead themselves. In a field experiment with 40,000 potential donors, we compared the overhead-free solution with other common uses of initial donations. Consistent with prior research, informing donors that seed money has already been raised increases donations, as does a {\$}1:{\$}1 matching campaign. Our main result, however, clearly shows that informing potential donors that overhead costs are covered by an initial donation significantly increases the donation rate by 80{\%} (or 94{\%}) and total donations by 75{\%} (or 89{\%}) compared with the seed (or matching) approach.},

abstract = {We review the emerging literature on climate and conflict. We consider multiple types of human conflict, including both interpersonal conflict, such as assault and murder, and intergroup conflict, including riots and civil war. We discuss key methodological issues in estimating causal relationships and largely focus on natural experiments that exploit variation in climate over time. Using a hierarchical meta-analysis that allows us to both estimate the mean effect and quantify the degree of variability across 55 studies, we find that deviations from moderate temperatures and precipitation patterns systematically increase conflict risk. Contemporaneous temperature has the largest average impact, with each 1$\sigma$ increase in temperature increasing interpersonal conflict by 2.4{\%} and intergroup conflict by 11.3{\%}. We conclude by highlighting research priorities, including a better understanding of the mechanisms linking climate to conflict, societies' ability to adapt to climatic changes, and the likely impacts of...},

abstract = {Existing research profiling consumer financial sophistication has examined specific decision errors that consumers may make in financial matters. While these errors have been replicated in multiple studies over the years, most have emerged from highly controlled experimental settings or through consumer surveys that measure only specific categories of financial behavior. This paper extends existing research on financial sophistication by utilizing an ethnographic study conducted over a 5-year time period. Results indicate that while some of the traditional categories of decision errors defined in earlier research affect consumers, decision errors not thoroughly examined in previous academic studies can have a notable and growing effect on consumers' financial decisions. Emerging categories of financial decision errors are identified, and shifts in consumers' financial behavior resulting from the financial crisis are profiled.

For example, the contributions of other donors can reduce an impact
philanthropist's charitable

can reduce aggregate giving. In

addition, impact philanthropy can lead to a codependent relationship
between givers and receivers in

which both benefit from the other. Finally, the model suggests a conflict
between charitable

organizations and its donors concerning the allocation of charitable
gifts. In particular, a charitable

organization prefers to spread a donor's contribution across many

Using giving and volunteering surveys conducted biannually from 1988 to 1996, I investigate the effect of a national fundraising campaign, "Give Five", on charitable giving and volunteering patterns. The widely advertised "Give Five" campaign was aimed to encourage people to give five percent of their income and volunteer five hours a week. After controlling for selection into being informed about the "Give Five", I find that people who were informed about the campaign increased their weekly volunteering activity on average by almost half an hour, but their giving behavior was not significantly affected. I discuss the policy implications associated with this result and argue that although the "Give Five" campaign did not achieve its goal, its economic impact was considerable.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

Estimating the cost or benefit of military service is complicated by the complex selection that determines who eventually serves in the military: On the one hand, potential conscripts have to pass medical and psychological examinations before entering the military, and on the other hand numerous (temporary) exemptions exist that can be manipulated by young men to avoid military service. We use substantial, policy-induced variation in aggregate military enrollment rates to deal with these selection issues. We find that approximately 10 years after serving in the military former conscripts have earnings that are on average 5{\%} lower than the earnings of members of their birth cohort who did not serve in the military. These findings are shown to be robust against a variety of specifications.},

Being ignored, excluded, and/or rejected signals a threat for which reflexive detection in the form of pain and distress is adaptive for survival. Brief ostracism episodes result in sadness and anger and threaten fundamental needs. Individuals then act to fortify or replenish their thwarted need or needs. Behavioral consequences appear to be split into two general categories: attempts to fortify relational needs (belonging, self-esteem, shared understanding, and trust), which lead generally to prosocial thoughts and behaviors, or attempts to fortify efficacy/existence needs of control and recognition that may be dealt with most efficiently through antisocial thoughts and behaviors. Available research on chronic exposure to ostracism appears to deplete coping resources, resulting in depression and helplessness.},

abstract = {The interpretation of instrumental variables (IV) estimates as local average treatment effects (LATE) of instrument-induced shifts in treatment raises concerns about their external validity and policy relevance. We examine how to move beyond LATE in situations where the instrument is discrete, as it often is in applied research. Discrete instruments do not give sufficient support to identify the full range of marginal treatment effects (MTE) in the usual local instrumental variable approach. We show how an alternative estimation approach allows identification of richer specifications of the MTE when the instrument is discrete. One result is that the alternative approach identifies a linear MTE model even with a single binary instrument. Although restrictive, the linear MTE model nests the standard IV estimator: The model gives the exact same estimate of LATE while at the same time providing a simple test for its external validity and a linear extrapolation. Another result is that the alternative approach allows identification of a general MTE model under the auxiliary assumption of additive separability between observed and unobserved heterogeneity in treatment effects. We apply these identification results to empirically assess the interaction between the quantity and quality of children. Motivated by the seminal quantity-quality model of fertility, a large and growing body of empirical research has used binary instruments to estimate LATEs of family size on child outcomes. We show that the effects of family size are both more varied and more extensive than what the LATEs suggest. Our MTE estimates reveal that the family size effects vary in magnitude and even sign, and that families act as if they possess some knowledge of the idiosyncratic effects in the fertility decision.},

abstract = {We examine how charitable giving is influenced by who in the household
is primarily responsible for giving decisions. Looking first at single-person
households, we find men and women to have significantly different
tastes for giving, setting up a potential conflict for married couples.
We find that, with respect to total giving, married households tend
to resolve these conflicts largely in favor of the husband's preferences.
Bargaining over charitable giving, rather than letting one spouse
take charge, is estimated to reduce giving by at least 6 percent.
When the woman is the decisionmaker, she will still make a significantly
different allocation of those charity dollars, preferring to give
to more charities but to give less to each. Our results give new
insights into both the demographics of charitable giving and the
costliness of household bargaining.},

We conduct two experiments: (i) individualized charitable giving where free riding incentives are shut down; and (ii) multi-donor charitable giving. We derive the demand for giving at different rebate conditions. Consistent with theory, the effect of competition on total donations is on average positive and its magnitude depends on the relative price. The social net benefit of rebate subsidies are calculated by comparing campaign costs and new donations generated.},

that social pressure affects the level of charitable contributions.
We find, however, that the form of the pressure is an important determinant
of the size of health contributions. Personal forms of solicitation
appear to increase contributions, relative to impersonal forms such
as media advertisements and mail campaigns. Within the class of personal
solicitations, we find that pressure to give which is exerted by
friends is more effective than requrests by strangers. Limited evidence
was also found that some workplace relationships result in more effective
fund-raising when compared to solicitations by strangers.},

We utilize a special feature at the Tel Aviv stock exchange (TASE): occasional shifts of securities from daily to weekly trading. If investors' decisions are influenced by trading frequency manipulation, then returns should be predictably affected. MLA results in a negative relation between risk aversion and the length of the evaluation period. Thus, the longer the evaluation period is, the lower the expected return is. This intuition also suggests reduced sensitivity to economic events in longer evaluation periods. We find strong support for MLA in the marketplace when testing expected return, as well as return sensitivity.},

Others argue that community and neighbourhood contacts are still important, for example, as a source of social support. According to Mollenhorst and colleagues, neighbours became more important in Dutch personal networks between 2000 and 2007. I assess how this developed between 2007-2008 and 2013. Next-door neighbours have (again) become more important. Neighbours are predominantly mentioned as associates who are visited and, increasingly, as associates who are asked for practical help. In contrast to Mollenhorst and colleagues, I find that the extent to which the Dutch like and trust neighbours in their network increased while contact frequency (further) declined. For highly educated residents, people without paid work, homeowners, and people with initially small local networks, the size of neighbour networks increased.},

over prices and (costly) {\^{A}}-socially and environmentally responsible{\^{A}}-

to reduce the price after the ethical producer's entry when his (non
ethical) location is fixed. His optimal price is halfway between
his zero profit price and the zero profit price of the ethical producer.
By removing the fixed location hypothesis we find that the ethical
producer{\^{A}}'s entry has positive indirect effects on aggregate social
and environmental responsibility since the incumbent finds it optimal
to imitate him when consumers{\^{A}}' perception of ethical costs is sufficiently
high.


In the paper we also show that the solution of the three-stage game
- in which location and prices are simultaneously chosen and the
profit maximising producer is Stackelberg leader in location {\^{A}}- has
three main features: minimum price differentiation, ethical imitation
and non minimal ethical differentiation. We explain the differences
between these findings and those from a traditional Hotelling game
as depending from three main features: i) the different goals of
the two (profit maximising and zero profit) competitors; ii) the
asymmetry in costs of "ethical" distance and iii) the lack of independence

Using giving and volunteering surveys conducted biannually from 1988 to 1996, I investigate the effect of a national fundraising campaign, "Give Five", on charitable giving and volunteering patterns. The widely advertised "Give Five" campaign was aimed to encourage people to give five percent of their income and volunteer five hours a week. After controlling for selection into being informed about the "Give Five", I find that people who were informed about the campaign increased their weekly volunteering activity on average by almost half an hour, but their giving behavior was not significantly affected. I discuss the policy implications associated with this result and argue that although the "Give Five" campaign did not achieve its goal, its economic impact was considerable.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

We divided the lottery-admitted group into, respectively, students who had not participated and students who had been rejected in the multifaceted selection process. We used ancova modelling, logistic regression and Bonferroni post hoc multiple-comparison tests and controlled for gender and cohort.: The top pre-university grade group achieved higher knowledge test scores and more Year 1 course credits than all other groups (p  0.05). This group received the highest possible professionalism score more often than the lottery-admitted group that had not participated in the multifaceted selection process (p  0.05). The group of students accepted in the multifaceted selection process obtained higher written test scores than the lottery-admitted group that had not participated (p  0.05) and achieved the highest possible professionalism score more often than both lottery-admitted groups. The lottery-admitted group that had not participated in the multifaceted selection process earned fewer Year 1 and 2 course credits than all other groups (p  0.05). Dropout rates differed among the groups (p  0.05), but correction for multiple comparisons rendered all pairwise differences non-significant.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: A top pre-university grade point average was the best predictor of performance. For so-called non-academic performance, the multifaceted selection process was efficient in identifying applicants with suitable skills. Participation in the multifaceted selection procedure seems to be predictive of higher performance. Further research is needed to assess whether our results are generalisable to other medical schools.},

abstract = {The average bonus paid to securities industry employees in New York City grew by 15 percent to 164,530 in 2013, which is the largest average bonus since the 2008 financial crisis, and the third highest on record, according to an estimate released today by New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli. The bonus estimate includes cash bonuses for the current year, supplemented by compensation deferred from prior years.
``Wall Street navigated through some rough patches last year and had a profitable year in 2013. Securities industry employees took home significantly higher bonuses on average,'' DiNapoli said. ``Although profits were lower than the prior year, the industry still had a good year in 2013 despite costly legal settlements and higher interest rates. Wall Street continues to demonstrate resilience as it evolves in a changing regulatory environment.},
