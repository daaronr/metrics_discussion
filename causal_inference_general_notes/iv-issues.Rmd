# IV and its many issues
BB added 17/06:
This is just really to highlight the point that IV really is pretty unreliable generally.
So [this paper](http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar_url?url=https://uh-ir.tdl.org/bitstream/handle/10657/4338/2019_ConsistencyWithoutInferenceInstrumentalVariables.pdf%3Fsequence%3D1&hl=en&sa=X&scisig=AAGBfm05pDW1C-mrVX9Sdp5WUPHeqmXSdQ&nossl=1&oi=scholarr) by Young highlights that the point estimates seem to not differ that much from OLS estimates... which i think suggests that IV is not (generally) dealing with the problem of OVB that it claims to
And then [this one](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3249910) is i think quite a neat comparison of IV and other methods. The general point being that IV seems to have more publication bias than the other approaches to causal inference. Not sure that is that much a of a surprise. My chat with one of the authors he point out that in IV it is hard (if not impossible) to simply plot the data and observe any causal changes. Like what would you have to plot in each case to show an effect through IV. whereas in DiD (which doesnt perform great either)/RD the its really easy to just graph the basic data and you can kind of eyeball that to see if there is any effect and if the assumptions are met (I actually think this kind of speaks somewhat for the need to really be able to test the assumptions at the heart of DiD and RD - it's so hard to provide a valid statistical test that just the fact we can eye-ball test the assumptions is useful). I also think that - in kind of a related way - there are many more places where there is experimenter dicrestion in the IV approach. 

## Instrument validity

- Exogeneity vs. exclusion
- Very hard to 'powerfully test'

IV not credible?	Note that for an instrument to be valid it needs to both be exogenously determined (i.e., not selected in a way related to the outcome of interest) and to also not have a *direct* effect on the outcome (only an indirect effect through the endogenous variable

## Heterogeneity and LATE

*Basic consideration: what does IV identify and when:*?

Focusing on a binary endogenous 'treatment' variable

- With heterogeneity
- With imperfect compliance
- With one-way compliance

## Weak instruments, other issues

- With a 'weak instrument' ... why does that matter?

## Reference to the use of IV in experiments/mediation
