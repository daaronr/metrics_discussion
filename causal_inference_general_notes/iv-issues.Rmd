# IV and its many issues


## Instrument validity

- Exogeneity vs. exclusion
- Very hard to 'powerfully test'

IV not credible?	Note that for an instrument to be valid it needs to both be exogenously determined (i.e., not selected in a way related to the outcome of interest) and to also not have a *direct* effect on the outcome (only an indirect effect through the endogenous variable

## Heterogeneity and LATE

*Basic consideration: what does IV identify and when:*?

Focusing on a binary endogenous 'treatment' variable

- With heterogeneity
- With imperfect compliance
- With one-way compliance

## Weak instruments, other issues

- With a 'weak instrument' ... why does that matter?

## Reference to the use of IV in experiments/mediation
