#  Course outline: Field Experiments---design, organization, implementation, (pre)-analysis, transparency


I'm planning a short course on this, which I will outline and flesh out here.
This will include "all the important, non-obvious, and teachable stuff"

Things like:

- Why run an experiment/how to frame a question (always illustrating this with 'non-obvious mistakes')
- Pre-registration and PaP; reasonable statistical methods and tests
- Finding and keeping project partners (but I'll go light on this because it is not so 'teachable')
- Organizing and documenting your project (including folder structure, github, literate code/dynamic docs)
- Power analysis and calculations
- Randomization and efficient allocation of treatments
- Scientific inference versus 'reinforcement learning'; tradeoffs
