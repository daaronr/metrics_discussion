<h2><span class="header-section-number">19.1</span> Evaluation of this resource</h2>
<p>This (2013) book seems to have some slightly outdated focus (terms like âdata-miningâ) but it is nonetheless very useful, both conceptually and in many specifics. It does a good job of giving actual insight into mathematical, statistical, and data-science techniques, and uses a reasonable amount of actual maths and some literal code. There is âmeat in this sandwich.â</p>
<p>Terms like âliftâ</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As another example, in evaluating the utility of a pattern, we see a notion of liftâ how much more prevalent a pattern is than would be expected by chanceârecurring broadly across data science. It is used to evaluate very different sorts of patterns in different contexts. Algorithms for targeting advertisements are evaluated by computing the lift one gets for the targeted population. Lift is used to judge the weight of evidence for or against a conclusion. Lift helps determine whether a co-occurrence (an association) in data is interesting, as opposed to simply being a natural consequence of popularity.</p>

<p>Target wanted to get a jump on their competition. They were interested in whether they could predict that people are expecting a baby. If they could, they would gain an advantage by making offers before their competitors. Using techniques of data science, Target analyzed historical data on customers who later were revealed to have been pregnant, and were able to extract information that could predict which consumers were pregnant. For example, pregnant mothers often change their diets, their wardrobes, their vitamin regimens, and so on. These indicators could be extracted from historical data, assembled into predictive models, and then deployed in marketing campaigns.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a few examples, if a consultant presents a proposal to mine a data asset to improve your business, you should be able to assess whether the proposal makes sense. If a competitor announces a new data partnership, you should recognize when it may put you at a strategic disadvantage. Or, letâs say you take a position with a venture firm and your first project is to assess the potential for investing in an advertising company. The founders present a convincing argument that they will realize significant value from a unique body of data they will collect, and on that basis are arguing for a substantially higher valuation. Is this reasonable? With an understanding of the fundamentals of data science you should be able to devise a few probing questions to determine whether their valuation arguments are plausible.</p>

<p>One very general and important concern during data preparation is to beware of âleaksâ (Kaufman et al.Â 2012). A leak is a situation where a variable collected in historical data gives information on the target variableâinformation that appears in historical data but is not actually available when the decision has to be made. As an example, when predicting whether at a particular point in time a website visitor would end her session or continue surfing to another page, the variable âtotal number of webpages visited in the sessionâ is predictive. However, the total number of webpages visited in the session would not be known until after the session was over (Kohavi et al., 2000)âat which point one would know the value for the target variable! As another illustrative example, consider predicting whether a customer will be a âbig spenderâ; knowing the categories of the items purchased (or worse, the amount of tax paid) are very predictive, but are not known at decision-making time (Kohavi &amp; Parekh, 2003).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>because if we take away the axis-parallel boundaries (see Figure 4-2) we can see that there clearly are other, possibly better, ways to partition</p>
</blockquote>
<p>example, we can separate the instances almost perfectly (by class) if we are allowed to introduce a boundary that is still a straight line, but is not perpendicular to the axes (</p>
<p>dataset of Figure 4-2 with a single linear split. This is called a linear classifier and is essentially a weighted sum of the values for the various attributes, as we will describe next.</p>
<p>Linear Discriminant Functions</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Equation 4-1. Classification function class(-) = { + if 1.0 - Age - 1.5 Ã Balance + 60 &gt; 0 - if 1.0 Ã Age - 1.5 Ã Balance + 60 â¤ 0 This is called a linear discriminant because it discriminates between the classes, and the function of the decision boundary is a linear combination-a weighted sumâof the attributes</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f(\cdot) = 60 + 1.0 \times Age - 1.5 \times Balance\)</span></p>
<p>To use this model as a linear discriminant, for a given instance represented by a feature vector x, we check whether f(x) is positive or negative. As discussed above, in the twodimensional case, this corresponds to seeing whether the instance x falls above or below the line</p>
<p>We now have a parameterized model: the weights of the linear function (<span class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span>) are the parameters.</p>
<p>Roughly, the larger the magnitude of a featureâs weight, the more important that feature is for classifying the target with standardization</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Optimizing an Objective Function. In fact, there are infinitely many lines (models) that classify this training set perfectly. Which should we pick? underdetermined</p>
</blockquote>
<p>for Scoring and Ranking InstancesIn other applications, we do not need a precise probability estimate. We simply need a score that will rank cases by the likelihood of belonging to one class or the other. For example, for targeted marketing we may have a limited budget for targeting prospective customers. We would like to have a list of consumers ranked by their predicted likeli- hood of responding positively to our offer</p>
<p>for Scoring and Ranking InstancesThus f(x) itselfâthe output of the linear discriminant functionâgives an intuitively satisfying ranking of the instances by their (estimated) likelihood of belong- ing to the class of interest.</p>
<p>Support Vector Machines, Briefly</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In short, support vector machines are linear discriminants</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>SVMs choose based on a simple, elegant idea: instead of thinking about separating with a line, first fit the fattest bar between the classes</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Then once the widest bar is found, the linear discriminant will be the center line through the bar</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>distance between the dashed parallel lines is called the margin around the linear discriminant, and thus the objective is to maximize the margin.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hopefully they will be distributed similarly to the training data, but they will in fact be different points. In particular, some of the positive examples will likely fall closer to the discriminant boundary than any positive example we have yet seen. All else being equal, the same applies to the negative examples. In other words, they may fall in the margin. The margin-maximizing boundary gives the maximal lee- way for classifying such points</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>original example of Figure 4-2 shows a situaâ tion in which a single line cannot perfectly separate the data into classes. This is true of most data from complex real-world applications</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the case where the data indeed are linearly separable, we incur no penalty and simply maximize the margin. If the data are not linearly separable, the best fit is some balance between a fat margin and a low total error penalty. The penalty for a misclassified point is proportional to the distance from the decision boundary, so if possible the SVM will make only -small" errors</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">19.4.6</span> Nonlinear Functions, Support Vector Machines, and Neural NetworksThe two most common families of techniques that are based on fitting the parameters of complex, nonlinear functions are nonlinear supportvector machines and neural networks.</h3>
<p>Support vector machines have a so-called âkernel functionâ that maps the original features to some other feature space. Then a linear model is fit to this new feature space, just as</p>
<p>implement a nonlinear support vector machine with a âpolynomial kerâ nel,- which essentially means it would considerâhigher-order" combinations</p>
<p>One can think of a neural network as a -stack" of models. On the bottom of the stack are the original features. From these features are learned a variety of relatively simple models. Let-s say these are logistic regressions. Then, each subsequent layer in the stack applies a simple model (let-s say, another logistic regression) to the outputs of the next layer down</p>
<p>We could think of this very roughly as first creating a set of -experts" in different facets of the problem (the first-layer models), and then learning how to weight the opinions of these different experts (the second-layer model).</p>
<p>more generally with neural networks target labels for training are provided only for the final layer (the actual target variable).</p>
<p>The stack of models can be represented by one big parameterized numeric function. The so why consider it in many layers?</p>
<p>we can then apply an optimization procedure to find the best parameters to this very complex numeric function</p>
<p>When weâre done, we have the parameters to all the models, and thereby have learned the -best" set of lower-level experts and also the best way to comâ bine them, all simultaneously "</p>
<p><strong>OF:</strong> Neural Networks are made up of layers of <em>perceptrons.</em> These models are given an input vector and assign weights to each input. The inputs are combined into a weighted sum which is passed through an âactivation functionâ that decides on the outcome classification. This method is known as âforward propagation.â A useful analogy from (Melania, 2019):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, you might get input from several friends on how much they liked a particular movie, but you trust some of those friendsâ taste in movies more than others. If the total amount of âfriend enthusiasmââgiving more weight to your more trusted friendsâis high enough (that is, greater than some unconscious threshold), you decide to go to the movie. This is how a perceptron would decide about movies, if only it had friends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
It is the way in which these weights are learned that is both mentally and computationally strenuous. The âback-propagationâ algorithm is key to the way that weights are learned. The procedure involves multiple stages. Essentially we initialize our model with a random state, feed our input data in and compute the error that our model has made. Then our model works backwards and updates the weights in a manner which provides a prediction consistent with the true data. This updating process can and often is done multiple times.</p>

<p>In many modern applications, where large numbers of models are built automatically, and/or where there are very large sets of attributes, manual selection may not be feasible.

In such cases there is no choice but to employ automatic feature selection (or to ignore feature selection all together).</p>

<p>So, for stopping tree growth, an alternative to setting a fixed size for the leaves is to conduct a hypothesis test at every leaf to determine whether the observed difference in (say) information gain could have been due to chance. If the hypothesis test concludes that it was likely not due to chance, then the split is accepted and the tree growing continues. (See -Sidebar: Beware of -multiple comparisons"" on page 139.)

<blockquote>
<p>The key is to realize that there was nothing special about the first training/test split we made. Let-s say we are saving the test set for a final assessment. We can take the training set and split it again into a training subset and a testing subset. Then we can build models on this training subset and pick the best model based on this testing subset. Let-s call the former the subtraining set and the latter the validation set for clarity. The validation set is separate from the final test set, on which we are never going to make any modeling decisions. This procedure is often called nested holdout testing. sorts out a key point of confusion</p>

<p><strong>OF:</strong> Note the importance of the bias-variance trade-off. As we increase the flexibility of a model, by for example adding more tree nodes, we decrease the bias but increase the variability. This means that the model will tend to perform poorly on newer data. The relative change of bias and variance helps determine whether the mean-squared error increases or decreases. These will vary across models. Highly non-linear models tend to have higher variation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>expected value computation provides a framework that is extremely useful in organizing thinking about data-analytic problems. Specifically, it decomposes data-analytic thinking into (i) the structure of the problem, (ii) the elements of the analysis that can be extracted from the data, and (iii) the elements of the analysis that need to be acquired from other sources (e.g., business knowledge of subject matter experts)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In an expected value calculation the possible outcomes of a situation are enumerated. The expected value is then the weighted average of the values of the different possible outcomes, where the weight given to each value is its probability of occurrence. For example, if the outcomes represent different possible levels of profit, an expected profit calculation weights heavily the highly likely levels of profit, while unlikely levels of profit are given little weight. For this book, we will assume that we are considering repeated tasks (like targeting a large number of consumers, or diagnosing a large number of problems) and we are interested in maximizing expected profit.1</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To be concrete, letâs say that a consumer buys the product for $200 and our productrelated costs are $100. To target the consumer with the offer, we also incur a cost. Letâs say that we mail some flashy marketing materials, and the overall cost including postage is $1, yielding a value (profit) of vR = $99 if the consumer responds (buys the product). Now, what about vNR, the value to us if the consumer does not respond? We still mailed the marketing materials, incurring a cost of $1 or equivalently a benefit of -$1. Now we are ready to say precisely whether we want to target this consumer: do we expect to make a profit? Technically, is the expected value (profit) of targeting greater than zero concrete example</p>

OF: <strong>What is clustering and why is it useful?</strong> Clustering analysis is a form of unsupervised learning which focuses around splitting data into groups. The aim of this is to identify key patterns in our data. For example: The supermarket Tesco may wish to identify which products are bought together by consumers. Using clustering may reveal that 80% customers who buy bread also buy milk. Insights such as these could be used in order to alter the layout of a supermarket in order to encourage higher spending.<br />
Whilst insights such as the one given in the example above are very simple, in larger datasets it can be much more difficult to draw insights such as these. Provided that the correct method is used, clustering is an incredibly powerful tool for exploring big datasets.<br />
Clustering uses distance measures in order to group similar observations into clusters.</p>
<p><strong>K-Means</strong>:
- Simple and easy to implement
- Efficient
- Difficult to know the value of K to specify
- Sensitive to the initial points chosen</p>
<p><strong>DBSCAN</strong>
- Very good at dealing with noise
- Can handle different shaped clusters
- Tends to perform worse when the density of data varies or when data is highly dimensional</p>
