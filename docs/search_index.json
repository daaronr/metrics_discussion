But I am open to collaboration with others on this. (Other contributors so far include Gerhard Riener, Oska Fentem, and Scott Dickerson) My focus: Microeconomics, behavioral economics, focus on charitable giving and ‘returns to education’ type of straightforward problems. (Minimal focus on structural approaches.) What I care about: Where we can add value to real econometric (and statistical and experimental design) practice? The data I focus on: Observational (esp. web-scraped and API data and national surveys/admin data) Experimental: esp. where with multiple crossed arms, and where the ‘cleanest design’ may not be possible I will assume familiarity with most basic statistical concepts like ‘bias’, ‘consistency’, and ‘null hypothesis testing.’ However, I will focus on some concepts that seem to often be misunderstood and mis-applied.

Hope you are doing well. I’ve just invited you to a shared Zotero group managing my bibliography/references. I think this should be useful.

I’m not going to explain the %&gt;% in this project, but you might learn more about in this brief clip, starting around minute 21:25 in this talk by Wickham, or in section 5.6.1 from Grolemund and Wickham’s R for Data Science. Really, all of Chapter 5 of R4DS is just great for new R and new tidyverse users. And R4DS Chapter 3 is a nice introduction to plotting with ggplot2. 3.5.2 Style and consistency lower_snake_case Use lower_snake_case to name all objects (that’s my preference anyways) unless there’s a strong reason to do otherwise. This includes: file_names.txt folder_names function_names (with few exceptions) names_of_data_objects_like_vectors names_of_data_output_objects_like_correlation_coefficients ex_df1 In R you probably should keep data frame names short to avoid excessive typing And by all that is holy, never put spaces or slashes in file or object names! This can make it very hard to process across systems… there are various ways of referring to spaces and other white space. 3.5.2.1 Indenting and spacing 3.5.3 Using functions, variable lists, etc., for clean, concise, readable code 3.5.4 Mapping over lists to produce results 3.5.5 Building results based on ‘lists of filters’ of the data set In writing a paper you very often want to produce ‘statistics A-F for subsets S1-S5’. Can’t we just automate this? We can store a filter as a character vector and then apply it selection_statement &lt;- &quot;Species == &#39;setosa&#39; &amp; Petal.Width&gt;0.3&quot; iris %&gt;% as.tibble() %&gt;% filter(rlang::eval_tidy(rlang::parse_expr(selection_statement))) Table 3.1: Sepal.LengthSepal.WidthPetal.LengthPetal.WidthSpecies 5.43.91.70.4setosa 5.74.41.50.4setosa 5.43.91.30.4setosa 5.13.71.50.4setosa 5.13.31.70.5setosa 5&nbsp;&nbsp;3.41.60.4setosa 5.43.41.50.4setosa 5&nbsp;&nbsp;3.51.60.6setosa 5.13.81.90.4setosa Making this a function for later use: selection_statement &lt;- &quot;Species == &#39;setosa&#39; &amp; Petal.Width&gt;0.3&quot; filter_parse = function(df, x) { {{df}} %&gt;% filter(rlang::eval_tidy(rlang::parse_expr({{x}}))) } iris %&gt;% as.tibble() %&gt;% filter_parse(selection_statement) Table 3.2: Sepal.LengthSepal.WidthPetal.LengthPetal.WidthSpecies 5.43.91.70.4setosa 5.74.41.50.4setosa 5.43.91.30.4setosa 5.13.71.50.4setosa 5.13.31.70.5setosa 5&nbsp;&nbsp;3.41.60.4setosa 5.43.41.50.4setosa 5&nbsp;&nbsp;3.51.60.6setosa 5.13.81.90.4setosa We can do the same for a list of character vectors of filter statements, and apply each filter from the list to the dataframe, and then the output function: sel_st &lt;- c(&quot;Species == &#39;setosa&#39; &amp; Petal.Width&gt;0.3&quot;, &quot;Species == &#39;virginica&#39; &amp; Petal.Width&gt;2.4&quot;) map(iris, selection_statement) ## $Sepal.Length ## NULL ## ## $Sepal.Width ## NULL ## ## $Petal.Length ## NULL ## ## $Petal.Width ## NULL ## ## $Species ## NULL sel_st %&gt;% map(~ filter_parse(iris, .x)) ## [[1]] ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## 1 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa ## 2 5.7 4.4 1.5 0.4 setosa ## 3 5.4 3.9 1.3 0.4 setosa ## 4 5.1 3.7 1.5 0.4 setosa ## 5 5.1 3.3 1.7 0.5 setosa ## 6 5.0 3.4 1.6 0.4 setosa ## 7 5.4 3.4 1.5 0.4 setosa ## 8 5.0 3.5 1.6 0.6 setosa ## 9 5.1 3.8 1.9 0.4 setosa ## ## [[2]] ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## 1 6.3 3.3 6.0 2.5 virginica ## 2 7.2 3.6 6.1 2.5 virginica ## 3 6.7 3.3 5.7 2.5 virginica It works nicely if you have a list of filters aligned with a list of names or other objects ‘specific to each filter’ (Code below: adapt to public data and explain) bal_sx &lt;- map2(subsets_sx_dur, subsets_sx_dur_name, function(x, y) { filter_parse(sa, x) %&gt;% dplyr::filter(stage == &quot;2&quot;) %&gt;% tabyl(treat_1, treat_2, show_missing_levels = FALSE) %&gt;% adornme_not(cap = paste(y, &quot;; 1st and 2nd stage treatments&quot;)) } ) 3.5.6 Coding style and indenting in Stata (one approach) I indent every line except clear, import, save, merge (‘file operations’) except where these occur as part of a loop, in which case I put in an ‘important comment’ noting these operations lines that call other do files important comments/flags/to-do’s I only put ‘small todo’ elements having to do with code in a code file itself (and even then there may be better places). If we are going to put todos I suggest we include #todo to search for these later (and R has a utility to collect these in a nice way… maybe Stata does too. Whenever there are more than 20 lines of something prosaic that cannot/has not been put into a loop or function, I suggest we put it in a separate ‘do’ file and call that do file (with no indent). That’s what I do here, giving a brief description and a ‘back link’. Sometimes I put all those do files into an separate folder. 3.6 Additional tips (integrate) When you have to upgrade R on Mac, how to preserve package installations - twitter thread This worked well for me.

Bad controls are variables that are themselves outcome variables in the notational experiment at hand. That is, bad controls might just as well be dependent variables too.\" – They could also be interpreted as endogenous variables. Example of looking at a regression of wages in schooling, controlling for college degree completion: Once we acknowledge the fact that college affects occupation, comparison of wages by college degree status within occupation are no longer apples to apples, even if college degree completion is randomly assigned.\" – The question here was whether to control for the category of occupation, not the college degree. It is also incorrect to say that the conditional comparison captures the part of the effect of college that is ‘not explained by occupation’ … so we would do better to control only for variables that are not themselves caused by education.\" 4.1.2 “Bad control” (“colliders”) Endogenous control: Are the control variables you use endogenous? (E.g., because FDI may itself affect GDP per capita) 4.1.3 Choices of lhs and rhs variables Missing data Choice of control variables and interactions Which outcome variable/variables 4.1.4 Functional form Logs and exponentials Nonlinear modeling (and interpreting coefficients) 4.1.4.1 ‘Testing for nonlinear terms’ Quadratic regressions are not diagnostic regarding u-shapedness: Simonsohn18 http://datacolada.org/62 4.1.5 OLS and heterogeneity 4.1.5.1 OLS does not identify the ATE (-) In general, with heterogeneity, OLS does not identify the ATE. It weights observations from different parts of the sample differently. Parts with greater residual variation in the treatment (outcome) variable are more (less) heavily weighted. E.g., if the treatment is binary, the estimator will most heavily weight those parts of the sample where the probability of treatment is closest to 1/2. The formula is … Some intuition Why is this the case? The OLS type estimators we are taught in Econometrics are ‘BLUE’ under the assumption of a single homogenous ‘effect’ (the ‘slope’… although the discussion itself is often agnostic as to whether this represents a causal effect). It is ‘best’ in a minimizing MSE sense under certain assumptions; in particular, we must also know the true functional form and the set of variables to be included. See ‘overfitting’ issues. In order to have the estimate of the true slope that minimizes the squared errors, OLS (and related estimators like FGLS; as well as 2SLS in a more complicated sense) weights some observations more than others. The ‘influence’ of an observation on the estimated slope depends on the nature of the variation in the dependent and independent variables in the region that observation is drawn from. Think of drawing a line through a set of points that were drawn with some noise from the true distribution. If you drew it based on a bunch of points (from a region where) the treatment varies very little and the outcomes have a lot of noise, the line you draw will be very sensitive to the latter noise and thus unreliable. So, would optimally ‘down-weight’ these observations in drawing the line. However, if the actual slope varies by region, this also means you are under-representing certain regions, and thus getting a biased estimate of the average slope. How can we deal with this? If we think that the treatment effect varies with observable variables, we could include ‘interactions’; essentially making separate estimates of the slope for each share of the population (but potentially allowing other control variables to have a homogenous effects, and pooled or clustered estimation of underlying variance.) …Although we may want to consider both overfitting here and the idea that there may be some shared component, so the fully-interacted model may be sub-optimal. See mixed modeling (?) However, this does not tell us how to recover the average of these slopes (approximately, the ATE). Should we weight each of the slopes by the share of the population that this group represents? Mechanically, the standard way of estimating and representing these interactions and economics has been with simple dummies (0,1) for each compared group. This yields a ‘base group’ (e.g., males aged 35-60) – this obviously does not recover the average slope– as well as the ‘adjustment’ coefficients. Another way of expressing interactions, particularly helpful with multi-level interactions is called ‘effect coding’: each group is coded as a ‘difference from 0’ (e.g,. males are -1/2 and females +1/2), before doing the interactions. This could allow for a more straightforward interpretation: at each level, the uninteracted term represents the average treatment effects, and the interacted terms represent adjustments relative to this average. But under which conditions is this in fact the case? [insert here]. WB blog - your-go-to regression-specification is -biased-here-s-simple-way-fix-it A key paper: http://www.jcsuarez.com/Files/Suarez_Serrato-BFE.pdf In particular, we compare treatment effect estimates using a fixed effects estimator (FE) to the average treatment effect (ATE) by replicating eight influential papers from the American Economic Review published between 2004 and 2009.1 Using these examples, we consider a randomized experiment in Section 1 as a case study and, in Section 3, we show generally that heterogeneous treatment effects are common and that the FE and ATE are often different in statistically and economically significant degrees. In all but one paper, there is at least one statistically significant source of treatment effect heterogeneity. In five papers, this heterogeneity induces the ATE to be statistically different from the FE estimate at the 5% level (7 of 8 are statistically different at the 10% level). Five of these differences are economically significant, which we define as an absolute difference exceeding 10%. Based upon these results, we conclude that methods that consistently estimate the ATE offer more interpretable results than standard FE models By “FE” here I think they mean group dummies; they are focused on cross-sectional and not panel data! While fixed effects permit different mean outcomesamong groups, the estimates of treatment effects are typically required to be the same; in more colloquial terms, the intercepts of the conditional expectation functions may differ, but not the slopes DGP \\[y_i = x_i \\beta_{g(i)} + \\mathbf{z_i}&#39; \\gamma + \\epsilon_i\\] where $y_i is the outcome for observation i among N [N what?], \\(x_i\\) is treatment or another variable of interest, and \\(z_i\\) contains control variables, including group-specific fixed effects. The treatment effects aregroup-specific for each of the \\(g=1,...,G\\) groups, where group membership is known for each observation. Defining ATE \\[\\beta^{ATE}=\\sum_g \\pi_g \\beta_g \\] where the \\(\\pi\\) terms are population frequencies The use of interaction terms is delicate… Modeling heterogeneity: the limits of Quantile re regression 4.1.6 “Null effects” “While the classical statistical framework is not terribly clear about when one should”“accept”\" a null hypothesis, we clearly should distinguish strong evidence for a small or zero effect from the evidence and consequent imprecise estimates. If our technique and identification strategy is valid, and we find estimates with confidence intervals closely down around zero, we may have some confidence that any effect, if it exists, is small, at least in this context. To more robustly assert a \"“zero or minimal effect”\" one would want to find these closely bounded around zero under a variety of conditions for generalizability. In general it is important to distinguish a lack of statistical power from a “tight” and informative null result; essentially by considering confidence intervals (or Bayesian credible intervals). See, e.g., Harms and Lakens (2018), “Making ‘null effects’ informative: statistical techniques and inferential frameworks”.\" Harms-lakens-18 4.1.6.1 Confidence intervals and Bayesian credible intervals 4.1.6.2 Comparing relative parameters E.g., “the treatment had a heterogeneous effect… we see a statistically significant positive effect for women but not for men”. This doesn’t cut it: we need to see a statistical test for the difference in these effects. (And also see caveat about multiple hypothesis testing and ex-post fishing). 4.1.7 Multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) A typical conversation (unfold) This isn’t really on the above discussion of the value of pre-reg, but on a topic that i think is at least somehwat related. Namely that when we have multiple hypotheses testing in a paper how do we control for that and what do our p-values really mean. Particulary, there is this paper by Alwyn Young which (I think) is basically saying that when we have a load of hypotheses within a study and then one has a significant p value we are quite a lot of the time picking up a false result. Obviously that isn’t very much of a surprise. But i think it also talks somewhat to the Steffano DellaVigna paper that was presented at the VAFE - that the publication bias really creeps in when we are publishing studies that have just one or two p values around 0.05. After all, it is those studies which have a real pay-off from getting that significant result. 4.1.8 Interaction terms and pitfalls See also ‘effect coding’ 4.1.8.1 ‘Moderators’ Confusion with nonlinearity Moderators: Heterogeneity mixed with nonlinearity/corners In the presence of nonlinearity, e.g., diminishing returns, if outcome ‘starts’ at a higher level for one group (e.g., women), it is hard to disentangle a heterogeneous response to the treatment from ‘the diminishing returns kicking in’.

Where is the burden of proof? Where a particular assumption is critical to identification and inference … iFailure to reject the violation of an assumption is not sufficient to give us confidence that it is satisfied and the results are credible. Authors frequently cite insignificant statistical tests as evidence in support of a substantive model, or of evidence that they do not need to worry about certain confounds. Although the problem of induction is difficult, I find this approach inadequate. Where a negative finding is given as an important result, the authors should also show that their parameter estimate is tightly bounded around zero. Where it is cited as evidence they can ignore a confound, they should provide evidence that they can statistically bound that effect is small enough that it should not reasonably cause an issue (e.g., as using Lee or McNemar bounds for selective attrition/hurdles). I am concerned with the interpretation of diagnostic testing, both in model selection, and in the defense of the exclusion restrictions or identification assumptions. It is problematic, when the basic consistency of the estimator (or a main finding of the paper) critically depends on such tests failing to reject a null hypothesis, to merely state that the ‘test failed to reject, therefore we maintain the null hypothesis’. How powerful are these tests? I.e. what is the probability of a false negative Type II error? How large a bias would be compatible with reasonable confidence intervals for these tests? 5.1.1 Further discussion: the DiD approach and ‘parallel trends’ BB 17/06: [In general] economists do … suggest that they have evidence which allows them to accept null hypotheses. The motivating example would be in the case of DiD estimation, where we have to assume parallel trends. My hunch is that fairly frequently people just say “yes we have evidence the trends were parallel pre-intervention” and then point away to something that shows a \\(p&gt;0.05\\) on pre-interenvetion differences in trend. Sometimes this is done better where they say ‘yeah here is a (relatively) tightly estimated zero effect.’ But what do we accept as good enough to show that? Building on that point, it seems that we do need something to tell us when DiD is valid and yet don’t yet have something. My hunch is that the answer may well lie in Bayesian approaches. DR’s suggestion was, I think, that we could maybe simultaneously try and estimate the difference in trends both before and after intervention simultaneously. DR: My idea was that a Bayesian approach would have involve a parameter for ‘differential trend’, with a prior (and then posterior) distribution over both this parameter and the ultimate estimate. I’ll look to find comparable approaches in the literature. BB: I was wondering about a less sophisticated approach in which we set up the prior to be not-parallel trends and see over what range of “not parallel” priors the posterior is pulled closer to the idea of there actually being a parallel trend. DR: It’s an interesting reframe, to place the burden of proof on the researcher; sort of ‘rejecting the null of a non-parallel trend’. But how can this work? And how to deal with the idea that the null could be a differential trend in either direction? @BB: And perhaps we should try to have this discussion using the specific equations and assumptions of DiD? BB: I think similar to what DR suggested above is what we used in the Bayesian approaches to do for Covid. Seems to me that the intervention in this case is the lockdown. There we assume that when a country locks down it reduces the R, and we estimate two different Rs. DR: Can you define this with a few equations to fix ideas? It’s hard to follow. BB: Thinking about that approach here, we could try and estimate a pre-intervention relationship between the two groups, and then introduce a post-intervention term which is asked to explain the residual of the variation in the intervention group post-treatment. BB: Again, I think they key would be trying to establish ‘over what prior assumptions for the pre-treatment trend is the posterior outcome for post-treatment effect in a particular direction.’ DR: Yes, essentially, we need to consider the sensitivity of the estimates to the assumption! But I think before we get into this we should definitely look at the tweet on DiD that you included as well as the drive folder of Patrick Button Just to add that there seem to some further papers we should take a look at.

All of the controls must still be exogenous, otherwise this itself can lead to a bias. There is some discussion of how to validate this approach; see, e.g., (Oster 2019). 6.2 Machine Learning (statistical learning): Lasso, Ridge, and more 6.2.1 Limitations to inference from learning approaches 6.3 Notes Hastie: Statistical Learning with Sparsity google books link 6.3.1 Introduction One form of simplicity is sparsity, the central theme of this book. Loosely speaking, a sparse statistical model is one in which only a relatively small number of parameters (or predictors) play an important role. “the \\(\\ell_1\\) norm is special” (abs value). Other norms yield nonconvex problems, hard to minimize. “bet on sparsity” principle: Use a procedure that does well in sparse problems, since no procedure does well in dense problems. Examples from gene mapping 6.3.1.1 Book roadmap Chapter 2 … lasso for linear regression, and a simple coordinate descent algorithm for its computation. Chapter 3 application of \\(\\ell_1\\) [lasso-type] penalties to generalized linear models such as multinomial and survival models, as well as support vector machines.

Ch 11: a survey of theoretical results for the lasso (Skip?) 6.3.2 Ch2: Lasso for linear models N samples (?N observations), want to approx the response variable using a linear combination of the predoctors OLS minimizes squared-error loss but Prediction accuracy OLS unbiased but ‘often has large variance’ prediction accuracy can be improved by shrinking coefficients (even to zero) yielding biased but perhaps better predictive estimators Interpretation: too many predictors hard to interpret DR: I do not care about this for fitting background noise in experiments 6.3.2.1 2.2 The Lasso Estimator Lasso bounds the sum of the abs values of coefficients, an \"$_1\" constraint. Lasso is OLS subject to \\(\\sum_{j=1..p}{\\abs(\\beta_j)}\\leq t\\) “compactly” \\(||\\beta||_1\\leq t\\) with notation for the “\\(\\ell_1\\) norm” Bound \\(t\\) acts as a ‘budget’, must be specified by an ‘external procedure’ such as cross-validation typically we must standardize the predictors $** so that each column is centered with unit variance … as well as the outcome variables (?) … can ignore intercept DR: Not clear here whether standardisation is necessary for the procedure to be valid or just convenient for explaining and deriving its properties. Aside: Can re-write Lasso minimization st constraint as a Lagrangian. \\(\\lambda\\) plays the same role as \\(t\\) in the constraint. Thus we can speak of the solution to the Lagrangian minimisation problem \\(\\hat{\\beta)_{\\lambda}\\) which also solves the bound problem with \\(t=||\\hat_{\\lambda}||_1\\). Aside: We often remove the \\(1/2n\\) term at the beginning of the minimization problem. Same minimization, minimizing sum of squared deviations rather than something like an average of this. Express (Karush-Kuhn-Tucker) optimisation conditions for this … Example from Thomas (1990) on crime data Typically … lasso is most useful for much larger problems, including “wide” data for which \\(p&gt;&gt;N\\) Fig 2.1: Lasso vs ridge regression; coefficients of each for a set of considered variables plotted against their respective norms (as shares of maximal bound on coefficient sum measure, i.e., ols, for each) Note ridge regression penalises squared sums of betas Fig 2.2., in \\(\\beta_1,\\beta_2\\) space illustrates the difference well: contour lines of Resid SS elipses, ‘budget constraint’ for each (disc vs diamond) (Note: lasso bound was chosen via cross-validation) No analytical statistical inference after lasso (some being developed?), bootstrap is common lasso sets two of the five coefficients to zero, and tends to shrink the coefficients of the others toward zero relative to the full least-squares estimate. DR: analytically and intuitively, I do not yet understand why lasso should shrink coefficients but not all the way to zero. The penalty is linear in the coefficient size, so I would think the solution would be bang-bang, either drop a coeficient or leave it unchanged. But it is not. Adding an increment to a \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) when it is below the OLS estimate should have a linear effect on the RSS (according to my memory and according to Sebastian). But that would mean that shrinking one parameter always yields a better benefit to cost ratio. Thus I should shrink each parameter to zero before beginning to shrink any others. This cannot be right! I looked up this derivative wrt the beta vector (one needs to set this to 0 to get the ols estimates stackexchange \\(\\frac{d RSS}{d \\beta}=-2X^{T}(y-X\\beta}\\) or \\(−\\frac{d e&#39;e}{d b}=2X′y+2X′Xb\\) The answer to this question: while the impact of changing each coefficient on SSR is in fact constant (a constant own-derivative), there is also an impact of changing one coefficient on the other derivatives. As one coefficient shrinks to zero the marginal impact of the other coefficients on the SSR may (will?) increase. - At the same time, we need that the effect of increasing it from zero need not be infinite, so it might not outweigh the linear penalty, thus some coefficients might be set to zero Relaxed lasso the least-squares fit on the subset of the three predictors tends to expand the lasso estimates away from zero. The nonzero estimates from the lasso tend to be biased toward zero, so the debiasing in the right panel can often improve the prediction error of the model. This two-stage process is also known as the relaxed lasso (Meinshausen 2007). DR: When is this likely to help/hurt relative to pure lasso? Stackexchange discussion Contrasts a ‘relaxed-lasso’ from a ‘lars-ols’ Aside: which seems better for Control variable selection for prediction/reducing noise to enable better inference of treatment effects? Ridge? better than Lasso here? We do not care about interpreting the predictors here… so if we allow \\(\\beta\\)‘s to be shrunk towards zero for each coefficient maybe that should yield better prediction than making them exactly zero? On the other hand if we know the true model is ‘parsimonious’ (as in the genes problem) it might boost efficiency to allow inference about coefficients that should be exactly zero (edited) 6.3.2.2 2.3 Cross-Validation and Inference Generalization ability accuracy for predicting independent test data from the same population … find the value of t that does best **Cross-validation procedure* randomly divide … dataset into K groups. “Typical choices … might be 5 or 10, and sometimes N.” One ‘test’, remaining K-1 ‘training’ Apply lasso to training data for a range of t values, use each fitted model to predict the responses in the test set, recording mean-squared prediction errors for each value of t.

The elastic net makes a compromise between the ridge and the lasso penalties (Zou and Hastie 2005)1] is a parameter that can be varied.

Machine intelligence became possible once researchers stopped approaching intelligence tasks procedurally and began tackling them empirically. Face recognition algorithms, for example, do not consist of hard-wired rules to scan for certain pixel combinations, based on human understanding of what constitutes a face. Instead, these algorithms use a large dataset of photos labeled as having a face or not to estimate a function f (x) that predicts the presence y of a face from pixels x (p2) &gt; supervised- machine learning, the focus of this article) revolves around the problem of prediction: produce predictions of y from x … manages to fit complex and very flexible functional forms to the data without simply overfitting; it finds functions that work well out-of-sample danger in using these tools is taking an algorithm built for [predicting \\(y\\)-] and presuming their [parameters \\(\\beta\\)] - have the properties we typically associate with estimation output One category of such applications appears when using new kinds of data for traditional questions; for example, in measuring economic activity using satellite images or in classifying industries using corporate 10-K filings. Making sense of complex data such as images and text often involves a prediction pre-processing step This middle category is most relevant for me In another category of applications, the key object of interest is actually a parameter … but the inference procedures (often implicitly) contain a prediction task. For example, the first stage of a linear instrumental variables regression is effectively prediction. The same is true when estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, testing for effects on multiple outcomes in experiments, and flexibly controlling for observed confounders A final category is in direct policy applications. Deciding which teacher to hire implicitly involves a prediction task (what added value will a given teacher have?), one that is intimately tied to the causal question of the value of an additional teacher. (p3) A useful (interactive?) example: We consider 10,000 randomly selected owner-occupied units from the 2011 metropolitan sample of the American Housing Survey. In addition to the values of each unit, we also include 150 variables that contain information about the unit and its location, such as the number of rooms, the base area, and the census region within the United States. To compare different prediction techniques, we evaluate how well each approach predicts (log) unit value on a separate hold-out set of 41,808 units from the same sample. All details on the sample and our empirical exercise can be found in an online appendix available with this paper at http://e-jep.org In-sample performance may overstate performance; this is especially true for certain machine learning algorithms like random forests that have a strong tendency to overfit. Second, on out-of-sample performance, machine learning algorithms such as random forests can do significantly better than ordinary least squares, even at moderate sample sizes and with a limited number of covariates (p4) algorithms are fitted on the same, randomly drawn training sample of 10,000 units and evaluated on the 41,808 remaining held-out units. Simply including all pairwise interactions would be infeasible as it produces more regressors than data points (especially considering that some variables are categorical Machine learning searches for these interactions automatically (p5) Shallow Regression Tree Predicting House Values not sure what’s going on here. is this the random forest thing? The prediction function takes the form of a tree that splits in two at every node. At each node of the tree, the value of a single variable (say, number of bathrooms) determines whether the left (less than two bathrooms) or the right (two or more) child node is considered next. When a terminal node-a leaf—is reached, a prediction is returned. An So how does machine learning manage to do out-of-sample prediction? The first part of the solution is regularization. In the tree case, instead of choosing the -best” overall tree, we could choose the best tree among those of a certain depth. (p5) Tree depth is an example of a regularizer. It measures the complexity of a function. As we regularize less, we do a better job at approximating the in-sample variation, but for the same reason, the wedge between in-sample and out-of-sample (p6) how do we choose the level of regularization (-tune the algorithm”)? This is the second key insight: empirical tuning. (p6) -tuning within the training sample In empirical tuning, we create an out-of-sample experiment inside the original sample. We fit on one part of the data and ask which level of regularization leads to the best performance on the other part of the data.4 We can increase the efficiency of this procedure through cross-validation: we randomly partition the sample into equally sized subsamples (-folds”). The estimation process then involves successively holding out one of the folds for evaluation while fitting the prediction function for a range of regularization parameters on all remaining folds. Finally, we pick the parameter with the best estimated average performance.5 The (p6) -! This procedure works because prediction quality is observable: both predictions y- and outcomes y are observed. Contrast this with parameter estimation, where typically we must rely on assumptions about the data-generating process to ensure consistency (p7) Some Machine Learning Algorithms Function class - (and its parametrization) Regularizer R( f ) Global/parametric predictors Linear -′x (and generalizations) Subset selection| (p7) -very useful table Some Machine Learning Algorithms Function class - (and its parametrization) Regularizer R( f ) Global/parametric predictors Linear -′x (and generalizations) Subset selection||β| (p7) Random forest (linear combination of trees (p7) -kernel in an ml framework! Kernel regression (p6) -but can we make inferences about the structure? hypothesis testing? Regularization combines with the observability of prediction quality to allow us to fit flexible functional forms and still find generalizable structure. (p7) Picking the prediction function then involves two steps: The first step is, conditional on a level of complexity, to pick the best in-sample loss-minimizing function.8 The second step is to estimate the optimal level of complexity using empirical tuning (as we saw in cross-validating the depth of the tree). (p8) -but they forgot to mention that others are shrunk linear regression in which only a small number of predictors from all possible variables are chosen to have nonzero values: the absolute-value regularizer encourages a coefficient vector where many are exactly zero. (p4) -why no ridge or elastic net? LASSO (p8) -ensembles usually win contests While it may be unsurprising that such ensembles perform well on average- after all, they can cover a wider array of functional forms-it may be more surprising that they come on top in virtually every prediction competition (p8) -neural nets broadly explained neural nets are popular prediction algorithms for image recognition tasks. For one standard implementation in binary prediction, the underlying function class is that of nested logistic regressions: The final prediction is a logistic transformation of a linear combination of variables (-neurons”) that are themselves such logistic transformations, creating a layered hierarchy of logit regressions. The complexity of these functions is controlled by the number of layers, the number of neurons per layer, and their connectivity (that is, how many variables from one level enter each logistic regression on the next) (p9) These choices about how to represent the features will interact with the regularizer and function class: A linear model can reproduce the log base area per room from log base area and log room number easily, while a regression tree would require many splits to do so. (p9) In a traditional estimator, replacing one set of variables by a set of transformed variables from which it could be reconstructed would not change the predictions, because the set of functions being chosen from has not changed. But with regularization, including these variables can improve predictions because-at any given level of regularization-the set of functions might change (p9) -!! Economic theory and content expertise play a crucial role in guiding where the algorithm looks for structure first. This is the sense in which -simply throw it all in- is an unreasonable way to understand or run these machine learning algorithms (p9) -I need hear of using adjusted r square for this Should out-ofsample performance be estimated using some known correction for overfitting (such as an adjusted R2 when it is available) or using cross-validation (p9) -big unknowns available finite-sample guidance on its implementation-such as heuristics for the number of folds (usually five to ten) or the -one standard-error rule” for tuning the LASSO (Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman 2009)-has a more ad-hoc flavor (p9) firewall principle: none of the data involved in fitting the prediction function-which includes crossvalidation to tune the algorithm—is used to evaluate the prediction function that is produced (p10) -how? First, econometrics can guide design choices, such as the number of folds or the function class (p10) with the fitted function. Why not also use it to learn something about the -underlying model (p10) -!! the lack of standard errors on the coefficients. Even when machine-learning predictors produce familiar output like linear functions, forming these standard errors can be more complicated than seems at first glance as they would have to account for the model selection itself. In fact, Leeb and P-tscher (2006, 2008) develop conditions under which it is impossible to obtain (uniformly) consistent estimates of the distribution of model parameters after data-driven selection (p11) -lasso chosen variables are unstable because of multicollinearity. a problem for making inferences from estimated coefficients the variables are correlated with each other (say the number of rooms of a house and its square-footage), then such variables are substitutes in predicting house prices. Similar predictions can be produced using very different variables. Which variables are actually chosen depends on the specific finite sample (p11) this creates an Achilles- heel: more functions mean a greater chance that two functions with very different (p12) coefficients can produce similar prediction quality (p12) In econometric terms, while the lack of standard errors illustrates the limitations to making inference after model selection, the challenge here is (uniform) model selection consistency itself (p12) -is this equally a problem for non sparsity based procedures like ridge? First, it encourages the choice of less complex, but wrong models. Even if the best model uses interactions of number of bathrooms with number of rooms, regularization may lead to a choice of a simpler (but worse) model that uses only number of fireplaces. Second, it can bring with it a cousin of omitted variable bias, where we are typically concerned with correlations between observed variables and unobserved ones. Here, when regularization excludes some variables, even a correlation between observed variables and other observed (but excluded) ones can create bias in the estimated coefficients (p12) Some econometric results also show the converse: when there is structure, it will be recovered at least asymptotically (for example, for prediction consistency of LASSO-type estimators in an approximately sparse linear framework, see Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Hansen 2011). (p12) -unrealistic for micro economic applications Zhao and Yu (2006) who establish asymptotic model-selection consistency for the LASSO. Besides assuming that the true model is -sparse”—only a few variables are relevant-they also require the “irrepresentable condition” between observables: loosely put, none of the irrelevant covariates can be even moderately related to the set of relevant ones. In practice, these assumptions are strong. (p13) Machine learning can deal with unconventional data that is too high-dimensional for standard estimation methods, including image and language information that we conventionally had not even thought of as data we can work with, let alone include in a regression (p13) satellite data (p13) they provide us with a large x vector of image-based data; these images are then matched (in what we hope is a representative sample) to yield data which form the y variable. This translation of satellite images to yield measures is a prediction problem (p13) particularly relevant where reliable data on economic outcomes are missing, such as in tracking and targeting poverty in developing countries (Blumenstock 2016 (p13) cell-phone data to measure wealth (p13) Google Street View to measure block-level income in New York City and Boston (p13) online posts can be made meaningful by labeling them with machine learning (p14) extract similarity of firms from their 10-K business description texts, generating new time-varying industry classifications for these firms (p14) and imputing even in traditional datasets. In this vein, Feigenbaum (2015a, b) applies machine-learning classifiers to match individuals in historical records (p13) -the first prediction applications New Data (p14) Prediction in the Service of Estimation (p14) linear instrumental variables understood as a two-stage procedure (p14) The first stage is typically handled as an estimation step. But this is effectively a prediction task: only the predictions x- enter the second stage; the coefficients in the first stage are merely a means to these fitted values. Understood this way, the finite-sample biases in instrumental variables are a consequence of overfitting (p14) -ll overfitting. Overfitting means that the in-sample fitted values x- pick up not only the signal -′z, but also the noise δ. As a consequence, xˆ is biased towards x, and the second-stage instrumental variable estimate - - is thus biased towards the ordinary least squares estimate of y on x. Since overfit will be larger when sample size is low, the number of instruments is high, or the instruments are weak, we can see why biases arise in these cases (p14) same techniques applied here result in split-sample instrumental variables (Angrist and Krueger 1995) and -jackknife” instrumental variables (Angrist, Imbens, and Krueger 1999) (p15) -worth referencing In particular, a set of papers has already introduced regularization into the first stage in a high-dimensional setting, including the LASSO (Belloni, Chen, Chernozhukov, and Hansen 2012) and ridge regression (Carrasco 2012; Hansen and Kozbur 2014). More recent extensions include nonlinear functional forms, all the way to neural nets (Hartford, Leyton-Brown, and Taddy 2016 (p15) Practically, even when there appears to be only a few instruments, the problem is effectively high-dimensional because there are many degrees of freedom in how instruments are actually constructed (p15) -a note of caution It allows us to let the data explicitly pick effective specifications, and thus allows us to recover more of the variation and construct stronger instruments, provided that predictions are constructed and used in a way that preserves the exclusion restriction (p15) -this seems similar to my idea of regularising on a subset Chernozhukov, Chetverikov, Demirer, Duflo, Hansen, and Newey (2016) take care of high-dimensional controls in treatment effect estimation by solving two simultaneous prediction problems, one in the outcome and one in the treatment equation (p15) the problem of verifying balance between treatment and control groups (such as when there is attrition (p15) -! Or consider the seemingly different problem of testing for effects on many outcomes. Both can be viewed as prediction problems (Ludwig, Mullainathan, and Spiess 2017). If treatment assignment can be predicted better than chance from pretreatment covariates, this is a sign of imbalance. If treatment assignment can be predicted from a set of outcomes, the treatment must have had an effect (p15) prediction task of mapping unit-level attributes to individual effect estimates (p15) Athey and Imbens (2016) use sample-splitting to obtain valid (conditional) inference on (p16) treatment effects that are estimated using decision trees, (p16) -look into the implication for treatment assignment with heterogeneity heterogenous treatment effects can be used to assign treatments; Misra and Dub- (2016) illustrate this on the problem of price targeting, applying Bayesian regularized methods to a large-scale experiment where prices were randomly assigned (p16) -caveat Suppose the algorithm chooses a tree that splits on education but not on age. Conditional on this tree, the estimated coefficients are consistent. But that does not imply that treatment effects do not also vary by age, as education may well covary with age; on other draws of the data, in fact, the same procedure could have chosen a tree that split on age instead (p16) Prediction in Policy (p16) -no .. can we predict who will gain most from admission? but even if we can what can we report?

Young, 2019 by Young highlights that the point estimates seem to not differ that much from OLS estimates… which i think suggests that IV is not (generally) dealing with the problem of OVB that it claims to. DR: My concerns tend to be more: With heterogeneity IV is not capturing the average effect, and often finds results that are very much driven by a particular subsample, often accentuating the supposed bias Many IV’s are not defensible and testing the identifying assumptions is basically impossible BB: And then (Brodeur, Cook, and Heyes 2018) (link) is I think quite a neat comparison of IV and other methods. The general point being that IV seems to have more publication bias than the other approaches to causal inference. Not sure that is that much of a surprise. In my chat with one of the authors he pointed out that in IV any changes are less obvious - in DiD (which doesnt perform great either)/RD the assumptions are much clearer to visualise on a graph. I also think that - in kind of a related way - there are many more places where there is [researcher] discretion in the IV approach. BB: Whereas in DiD (which doesn’t perform great either)/RD the its really easy to just graph the basic data and you can kind of eyeball that to see if there is any effect and if the assumptions are met (I actually think this kind of speaks somewhat for the need to really be able to test the assumptions at the heart of DiD and RD - it’s so hard to provide a valid statistical test that just the fact we can eye-ball test the assumptions is useful).

This Freyaldenhoven paper might also be handy. And it looks like there is quite a lot by Susan Athey that we should look at too. Re Athey, she has a paper with Imbens (2006) which proposes the change in changes approach which allows estimation of hetergoenous treatment effects in a “better” way than quantile DiD. The assumptions of CiC are pretty similar to those of DiD. That method (CiC) is applied by this Assuncao paper to the Amazon. We actually looked at this paper at the journal club in LEEP and the point was raised that actually you could see the observed effect (reduced deforestation in targetted municipalities) simply owing to the fact there is very little other forest left to harvest. On DiD more generally, I think it suffers from the flaw that we have to somehow establish pre-treatment parallel trends which is basically an issue of ‘accepting a null hypothesis’ which is clearly not possible with traditional statistical inference.

Suppose we observe treatment \\(T\\) (e.g., ‘allowed to enter first-choice institution and course’), intermediate outcome \\(M\\) (e.g., completion of degree in first-choice course and institution), and final outcome \\(Y\\) (e.g., lifetime income.) Alternately, in the “substitution between charities” (@subst) context… (unfold) The treatment \\(T\\) is ‘asked to donate in the first round’ (in Reinstein, Riener and Vance-McMullen, henceforth ‘RRV’ experiments, and perhaps in Schmitz 2019)’, a greater incentive or a nudge to donate in round 1 (Heger and Slonim, 2020; others?), the inclusion of (an incentive to donate to) an additional charity in that same round (Reinstein 2006; Filiz-Ozbay and Uler; many others), the intermediate outcome \\(M\\) is the amount given to that (first-round) charity, and the final outcome \\(Y\\) is the amount given to that charity (or other charities) in round 2 (experiments “3”: other charities in that round ). The treatment \\(T\\) (may) directly affect the final outcome \\(Y\\). Do: show a diagram here \\[T\\rightarrow Y\\] \\(T\\) also may affect an intermediate outcome \\(M\\). \\[T \\rightarrow M\\] The intermediate outcome also may affect the final outcome \\(Y\\). \\[M \\rightarrow Y\\] With exogenous variation in \\(T\\) and \\(M\\) (or identified instruments for each of these), we should be able to estimate each of these three relationships as functions. With homogeneous (and in a simplest case linear and separate) effects we can then use these functions to compute the total (direct plus indirect) effect of \\(T\\) on \\(Y\\). We could also compute the share of this effect that occurs via the intermediate effect, i.e., \\(T \\rightarrow M\\rightarrow Y\\). This should be merely the composition of these two functions, or, in the linear case, the product of the slope coefficients. However, there are two major challenges to this estimation. We (may) have a valid instrument for (exogenous variation in) \\(T\\) only, and \\(M\\) may arise through a process involving selection on unobserved variables. Each of the three above relationships (as well as the selection equation) may involve heterogeneous functions; i.e., differential treatment effects. Thus we consult the relevant literature, discussed below. The most influential paper in Economics has been (Heckman, Pinto, and Heckman 2013). It is cited in more recent applied work such as Fagereng, 2018 (unfold). … We follow Heckman et al. (2013) and Heckman and Pinto (2015) in using mediation analysis. The goal of this analysis is to disentangle the average causal effect on outcomes that operate through two channels: a) Indirect effects arising from the effect of treatment on measured mediators, and b) direct effects that operate through channels other than changes in the measured mediators (including changes in mediators that are not observed by the analyst and changes in the mapping between mediators and outcomes). It is therefore necessary to assume that the mediators we do not observe are uncorrelated with both \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) and the measured mediators for all values of \\(D\\). Antonakis, coming from the Psychology and Leadership disciplines, considers the mediation question in a much simpler set of models. 9.3 Econometric Mediation Analyses (Heckman and Pinto) Econometric Mediation Analyses: Identifying the Sources of Treatment Effects from Experimentally Estimated Production Technologies with Unmeasured and Mismeasured Inputs Relevance to Parey et al We have an instrument for admission to one’s first-choice institution (and course-subject). Our result show an impact of this admission on future income, for at least some groups. However, this effect could come through any of a number of channels. We observe some of these ‘intermediate outcomes’, including course enrollment, course completion, medical specialization, and location of residence, but we do not have specific instruments for each of these. a lot of work might yield an instrument for specialization; I hear there is a lottery at that level as well 9.3.1 Summary and key modeling There is a ‘production function’ cf income as a function of human capital, opportunities, etc. cf donation as a function of income, prices, mood, framing, etc. Treatments (e.g., RCTs) may affect outcomes through the following channels: observable or proxied inputs Cf degree obtained, specialization entered, years of study, moving away from parents, location of residence as proxy for job opportunities Cf donation in first stage (to targeted charity), measured/self reported attitudes towards charities, self-reported mood unobservable/unmeasured inputs cf human capital, social connections cf unobservable generosity, wealth, or temporary mood the production function itself, the ‘map between inputs and outputs for treatment group members’ Cf does the institution itself directly shift the income?, does it change the impact of entering a specialization, does human capital ‘matter more’ at some institutions? Cf Does he treatment affect the impact of having made the first donation on later donations , or the effect of mood on donating.. ; what else? If treatments affect unmeasured inputs in a way not statistically independent of measured inputs, this biases estimates of the effect of measured inputs. RCTs unaided by additional assumptions do not allow the analyst to identify the causal effect of increases in measured inputs on outputs ... [nor distinguish effects from changes in production functions]. Here “we can test some of the strong assumptions implicitly invoked”. “Direct effects” as commonly stated refer to the impact of both channels 2 and 3 above. DR: Channel 2 isn’t really a direct effect imho (what was this?) Standard potential outcomes framework: \\[Y=DY_{1}+(1-D)Y_{0}\\] \\[ATE=E(Y_{1}-Y_{0})\\] Production function \\[Y_{d}=f_{d}(\\mathbf{\\mathbf{{\\theta}}}_{d}^{p},\\mathbf{\\mathbf{{\\theta}}}_{d}^{u},\\mathbf{{X}}),d\\in\\left\\{ 0,1\\right\\}\\] ... the function under treatment \\(d\\); of proxied and unobserved inputs that occur under state \\(d\\), and baseline variables. The production function implies: \\[ATE=E\\Big(f_{1}(\\mathbf{\\mathbf{{\\theta}}}_{1}^{p},\\mathbf{\\mathbf{{\\theta}}}_{1}^{u},\\mathbf{{X}})-f_{0}(\\mathbf{\\mathbf{{\\theta}}}_{0}^{p},\\mathbf{\\mathbf{{\\theta}}}_{0}^{u},\\mathbf{{X}})\\Big)\\] We also consider counterfactual outputs, fixing treatment status and proxied inputs: \\[Y_{d,\\bar{\\theta_{d}}^{p}}=f_{d}(\\mathbf{\\mathbf{{\\bar{{\\theta}}}}}_{d}^{p},\\mathbf{\\mathbf{{\\theta}}}_{d}^{u},\\mathbf{{X}}),d\\in\\left\\{ 0,1\\right\\}\\] This allows us to decompose (‘as in the mediation literature’): \\[ATE(d)=IE(d)+DE(d)\\] IE, Indirect effect: allows only the proxied inputs to vary with the treatment (holds the rest fixed at one of the two treatment statuses) DE, Direct effect: allows technology and the distribution of unobservables to vary with the treatment (holds proxied inputs fixed at one of the two treatment statuses) HP further decompose the direct effect into: \\(DE&#39;(d,d&#39;)\\): The impact of letting the treatment vary the map only (fixing the rest at one of the two appropriate values) \\(DE&#39;&#39;(d,d&#39;)\\): The impact of letting the treatment vary the unmeasured inputs only (fixing the rest at one of the two appropriate values) They use this to give two further ways of decomposing the ATE. 9.3.2 Common assumptions and their implications “The standard literature on mediation analysis in psychology regresses outputs on mediator inputs” ... often adopts the strong assumptions of: no variation in unmeasured inputs conditional on the treatment (implying the effects of these are summarized by a treatment dummy) and Cf ‘winning institution’ impacts human capital, social networks, etc identically for everyone; e.g., not a greater effect for men then for women, nor a greater effect for those entering particular specializations. full invariance of the production function: \\(f_{1}=f_{0}\\). ... which implies \\(Y_{d}=f(\\mathbf{\\theta}_{d}^{p},d,\\mathbf{X})\\). Sequential ignorability (Imai et al, 10, ’11): Essentially, independent randomization of both treatment status and measured inputs. Cf ‘winning institution’ does not effect the specialization entered nor the location of residence, nor are both determined by a third factor. This sentence is hard to follow: In other words, input \\(\\theta_{d&#39;}^{p}\\) is statistically independent of potential outputs when treatment is fixed at \\(D=d\\) and measured inputs are fixed at \\(\\bar{\\theta_{d&#39;}^{p}}\\) conditional on treatment assignment \\(D\\) and same preprogram characteristics \\(X\\). This assumption yields the ‘mediation formulas’: \\begin{aligned} E(IE(d)|X)= &amp; E(Y|^{p}=t,D=d,X){{}} &amp; (9)\\ E(DE(d)|X)= &amp; {}expe_{} &amp; (10) \\end{aligned} (??F is presumably the distribution over the observables; where did the unobservables go? They are in the expectations, I guess.) Difference from RCT What RCT doesn’t do: [sequential ignorability] translates into ... no confounding effects on both treatments and measured inputs ... does not follow from a randomized assignment of treatment ...[which] ensures independence between treatment status and counterfactual inputs/outputs ... [but not] between proxied inputs \\(\\theta_{d}^{p}\\) and unmeasured inputs \\(\\theta_{d}^{u}\\). [Thus not between counterfactual outputs and measured inputs is assumed in condition (ii).] Cf, randomizing ‘win first-choice institution’ does not guarantee that the choice (potential choice under winning/losing institution) to enter a particular specialty is independent of (potential after winning/losing institution) unobserved human capital gains at an institution. The (potential) choiceof specialty is alsonot guaranteed choice independent of potential incomes (holding proxy inputs like specialty constant) if winning/losing institution. What RCT does do: RCT ensures “independence between treatment status and counterfactual inputs/outputs”, thus identifying ’treatment effects for proxied inputs and for outputs. CF, we can identify the impact of the treatment ‘win first chosen institution’ on proxied input like ‘enters a specialization’ and on outputs like ‘income in observed years.’ 9.4 Pinto (2015), Selection Bias in a Controlled Experiment: The Case of Moving to Opportunity Summary ... 4000+ families targeted, incentive to relocate from projects to better neighbourhoods. Easy to identify impact of vouchers Challenge (here) is to assess impact of neighborhoods on outcomes. Method here to decompose the TEOT into unambiguously interpreted effects. Method applicable to ‘unordered choice models with categorical instrumental variables and multiple treatments’ Finds significant causal effect on labour market outcomes Relevance to Parey et al We also have an instrument (DUO lottery numbers) cleanly identifying the effect of the ‘opportunity to do something’ (in our case, to enter the course at your preferred institution). However, we also want to measure the impact of choices ‘encouraged’ by the instrument, such as (i) attending the first choice course and institution and (ii) completing this course. We also deal with unordered choices (i. enter course and institution, enter course at other institution, enter other course at institution, enter neither) (ii. choice of medical specialisation) The geographic outcome is relevant to our second paper (impact on ‘lives close to home’) Introduction The causal link between neighborhood characteristics and resident’s outcomes has seldom been assessed. Treatments: Control (no voucher) Experimental: could use voucher to lease in low-poverty neighborhood Section 8: Could use voucher in any () neighborhood Many papers evaluate the ITT or TOT effects of MTO. ITT: effect of being offered voucher estimated as difference in average outcome of experimental vs control families TOT: effect for ‘voucher compliers’ (assuming no effect of simply being offered voucher on those who don’t use it) estimated as ITT/compliance rate [ITT and TOT] are the most useful parameters to investigate the effects of offering [EA] rent subsidising vouchers to families.

Cf: Considering the ‘treatments’: ‘1: enter other course at fp-inst, ’2: enter course at fp-inst’, ‘3: enter course at non-fp inst’ (I ignore other course at other institution for now) Looking among those who won the course lottery (so we have a binary instrument: wininst \\(Z_{\\omega}\\in{0,1\\}}\\) Our reduced-form estimates (regressions on the ‘lottery number wins institution’ dummy) measures the probablility-weighted sum of: impact of institution within course ($T_{}=$2 versus 3); for those who would ‘fully comply’ (enter course at institution if \\(Z_{\\omega}=1\\), enter course at other institution if 0) impact of the course at fp-institution versus second-best course at fp-institution for ‘institution-loving’ noncompliers; those who would enter the course only if they get the fp-institution and otherwise another course at the same institution effects for perverse defiers 9.5 Antonakis approaches Insert notes here List of references "],["selection-cop.html", "10 Causal pathways: selection, corners, hurdles, and ‘conditional on’ estimates 10.1 ‘Corner solution’ or hurdle variables and ‘Conditional on Positive’ 10.2 Bounding approaches (Lee, Manski, etc)", " 10 Causal pathways: selection, corners, hurdles, and ‘conditional on’ estimates 10.1 ‘Corner solution’ or hurdle variables and ‘Conditional on Positive’ “Conditional on positive”/“intensive margin” analysis ignores selection “Conditional on positive”/“intensive margin” analysis ignores selection identification issue See (Angrist and Pischke 2008) on “Good CoP, bad CoP”.

Unfortunately, exclusively studying the effect on total earnings leaves open the question of whether any earnings gains are achieved through raising individuals hypothesis wage rates (price affects or hours of work (quantity effects). Important methodological point to constantly bring up: “even a randomized experiment cannot guarantee the treatment and control individuals will be comparable conditional on being employed.” Claims that standard “parametric or semi-parametric methods for correcting sample selection require exclusion restrictions that have little justification in this case.” Notes that most of the baseline variables could affect employment probabilities or have a direct impact on wage rates. Summary of the method: “…amounts to first identifying the excess number of individuals who were induced to be selected (employed) because of the treatment and then trimming the upper and lower tails of the outcome… distribution by this number, yielding a worst-case scenario bound.” Uses same assumptions as in “conventional models for sample selection” regressor of interest is independent of the errors in the outcome and selection models selection equations – this is ensured by random assignment. “the selection equation can be written as a standard latent variable binary response model” – what meaningful restriction does this impose? He proves this procedure “yields the tightest bounds for the average treatment effect that are consistent with the observed data.” The bounds estimator is shown to be \\(\\sqrt(n)\\) consistent and asymptotically normal with an intuitive expression for its asymptotic variance which depends on the variance of the trimmed outcome and the trimming threshold, an estimated quantifiable; (and an added term accounting for the estimation of which quantile to trim on) Note for charity experiment (unfold) (@subst) – DR, Note, charity data: We can make confidence statements over the bounds themselves. Will this procedure be easy to bring into our code? – In our (charity) experiment we in fact do have upper bounds on the outcome variable. Could this yield even greater efficiency? Note for the Netherlands data: (unfold, @NL) it is not immediately clear how this could be adapted to instrumental variables; we shall see. Can we recover something meaningful from the reduced form model they are? Can it be applied to the (instrumental variables) estimates to disentangle the impact of changing courses from the impact of the institution itself? In Lee’s paper, the estimate seems to give very narrow and informative bounds even though they have a great many people who do not earn any wages as a share of the population, about 54%. These are much narrower than the bounds proposed by Horowitz and M then what those bounds produce. 10.2.1.0.2 The National Job Corps Study and Sample Selection [prior approaches] In the experiment discussed here those in the control group were embargoed from the program for three years but could join afterwards, thus “when I use the phrase ‘effect of the program’ I am referring to this reduced-form treatment effect”, i.e., the intent to treat effect. – “some subpopulations were randomized into the program group with differing, but known probabilities. Thus analyzing the data requires the use of design weights.” Note: (\\(???)) this bears some resemblance to our Dutch data situation, and we can probably use examples from analyses of these programs. We can check their code against ours. – Note also that they impute means of the baseline variables with their means; this seems to be an accepted practice. Lee notes that he focuses exclusively on the “sample selection on wages caused by employment” and not the attrition/nonresponse problem, to focus attention on this, but they could have used it for the other as well. – DR: (@NL) Note again that their desire to separate the employment hours and wage effects of the program is very similar to our desire to separate out different margins of the impact of winning an institution. …Namely the impact on completing a course or starting a course versus other impacts and the impact of entering a specialization versus remaining impacts. …Similar decompositions for the geography outcomes. – To do: check whether any papers cite Lee using an IV approach, extending the technique and the estimation of variance. “the problem of nonrandom sample selection is well-understood in the training literature; … may be one of the reasons why most evaluations of job-training programs focus on total earnings, including zeros for those without a job, rather than on wages conditional on employment” “of the 24 studies referenced in a survey … (Heckman et al.)… Most examine annual, quarterly, or monthly earnings without discussing the sample selection problem examining rage rates.” – DR: (@NL)Note that this is relevant to our question of whether to exclude zeros in log models, etc. While there will be less unemployment in our data, it still may be a relevant influence made have a strong effect on the estimates. …previous conventional approaches to the sample selection problem (skip if desired). One may explicitly model the process determining selection, such as in Heckman (1979) … Separate equations for the wage and the propensity to be employed, where employment occurs if the latter crosses a particular threshold, in which case a wage is observed. It is reasonable to think that the treatment variable can have effects on both terms.. “sample selection bias can be seen as specification error in the conditional expectation…” The expected wage conditional on treatment exogenous variables and the selection into working (that is the underlying propensity to work variable exceeding zero) his status is equal to the true effect of the treatment an adjustment for the differences in the observable’s exogenous variables and a bias term representing the expectation of the idiosyncratic unobservables given the treatment and the exogenous variables exceeding the value necessary to induce work participation. The unobservable term needs to exceed the prediction based on the observable term for the entire term to exceed zero inducing labor force participation. One may assume the data are missing at random, perhaps conditional on a set of covariates (Rubin, 1976; essentially assuming the error terms in each equation are independent of one another, here “employment status is unrelated to the determination of wages”… This “is strictly inconsistent with standard models of labor supply that account for the participation decision (Heckman, 1974).” A more common assumption is that some exogenous variables “determine sample selection but do not have their own direct impact on the outcome of interest…. Exclusion restrictions are used in parametric and semi-parametric models…” but “there may not exist credible ’instruments… excluded from the outcome equation” – DR, aside: We can return to (our) previous papers to impose these Lee bounds! One example would be the Siskel and Ebert your reviews paper and perhaps incorporating us with subsequent approaches, considering the “selection to review” equation. Second approach “the construction of worst-case scenario bounds of the treatment effect” “Impute missing data with either the largest or smallest possible values to compute the largest and smallest possible treatment effects consistent with the data” as in Horwitz and Manski (2000a) who provide a general framework for this. Particularly useful with binary outcomes. This cannot be used when the support is unbounded. … note in their replication example they are actually using the equivalent of the bottom 5th percentile and the top 95th percentile. Strictly using a procedure would provide even wider bounds. Lee considers his approach to be a hybrid of the two previous general approaches. …end of section 2.. .a statement of the Horwitz upper bound for the treatment effect; very intuitive: “what if everyone in the treatment who dropped out would have had the largest possible wage and everyone in the control group that drop out would’ve had the smallest possible wage; this will give the upper bound.” Switching this the other way around will give a lower bound. DR, an aside thought: (@NL) Something akin to the Horwitz and M approach (or maybe Lee bounds) could be applied to our issue of swapping into institutions directly. Suppose we only focus on those who actually complied: those assigned to an institution who also went to that institution. Our concern was that this would under-represent those who had particularly strong institutional preferences. Suppose you are interested in looking at the impact of winning the lottery (for once preferred institution) itself, as that was our most simply identifiable outcome. … Let’s consider evaluating a treatment effect for those who happened to swap in. Those who swapped in might be assigned a counter-factual outcome of the lowest value of the lifetime income among those who did not get their institution of choice. Similarly, the small group who swapped out might be assigned a counterfactual outcome (had they no swapped out) representing the highest outcome value for those who did get their institution of choice. This should give us an upper bound on the treatment effect for these two groups of what we might call non-compliers. Making the opposite assumptions, precisely that those who swapped into their institution of choice would’ve had a very good counterfactual outcome (if they had not got their institution of choice) that comes from the highest outcomes for those who didn’t get their institution of choice (and also reversing this for those who swapped out of their preferred institution) would give us a lower bound for the treatment effect for this group. We can then combine these bounded treatment effects for these non-compliers with the treatment effect for the compliers to get a measure of the average treatment effect with bounds for this sort of behavior. This will also allow us to come up with estimates with bounds without having to use the instrumental variable strategy which has issues of its own. 10.2.1.0.3 Section 3: identification of bounds on treatment effects; the main meat of the model He starts with a simple example. He begins with a model with a treatment indicator and no other covariates, and a continuous outcome variable, but notes that this will clearly apply to discrete outcome variables and will also apply conditional on controls. Nest, he brings forward the statement… from the earlier selection models. In each case the latent variable must overcome a hurdle for the outcome to be observed and in fact the hurdle differs depending on the impact of the treatment itself. In general when the errors in the selection and outcome equations are correlated the difference in these means differs from the actual treatment effect. In other words through a slightly complicated story, when those who have unobservables that make them more likely to work also tend to have unobservables that would make them likely to earn more the standard difference in outcomes between control and treatment will not describe the true treatment effect. A key insight seems to be that we could identify the treatment effect if we could estimate the expected outcome given treatment and given that the unobservable component in the selection equation would lead to an observable outcome had the person not been given treatment. If so, we could subtract the observed mean control outcome from the above to yield the true treatment effect (for those who would be observed always). However, we obviously do not observe this because we only observe the outcomes for those who are treated where the selection equation is in fact positive and not “where the selection equation would have been positive had they not been treated.” However, the insight here is that this term can in fact be bounded. We do observe these outcomes for the treated people (note we are assuming without loss of generality that the treatment raises the probability of selection for this discussion) but we don’t know exactly which ones they are. In other words, we observe outcomes for more people in the treatment group than we need; we wish we could figure out what is the subset of these that would have also been observed had they not been treated, so we could compare like-to-like. The observed treatment mean is a weighted average of the thing we are seeking (to difference from the control) and “the mean for a subpopulation of marginal individuals… that are induced to be selected into the sample because of the treatment” This then gets us the upper bound for the term expressing the treatment outcome for those who would have been observed even if they had been in the control. The upper bound for this is the expected outcome for those in the treated group (who are observed of course) and who are in quantile-p or above of the outcome, where this \\(p\\) is the share of the treated population that are in the marginal group we referred to that were only induced to be selected into the sample because of the treatment. In other words the worst case scenario is that the smallest share \\(p\\) values of \\(Y\\) are in the marginal group and the largest one (which is share 1-pone are in the inframarginal group. We don’t know which observations are inframarginal and which ones are marginal. \\(p\\): the share of marginal individuals and (1-p) the share of inframarginal individuals (the latter is group we want the average outcome for). The highest could be would be the average outcomefor the largest (1-p) share of this group. We are looking for the expectation given that they are at or above at will at or above percentile p within this group. In other words we trim the lower tail of the Y distribution by the portion \\(p\\), (so what remains is the 1-p share) to get the upper bound for the inframarginal groups mean. We can then subtract the mean for the control group to get an upper bound for the treatment effect. To compute this “trimming proportion p”: this p is equal to the share of the treated group whose outcome is observed minus the share of the control group whose outcome is deserved is observed, divided by the share of the treatment group where the outcome is observed. Something like the increased likelihood of observation that is driven by the treatment, as a share of the total number as a share of the probability of observation in the treatment group. The average observed outcome for the treatment group is including too many observations; we need to difference out the share of observations that are observed only because the treatment caused them to be observed; this share is certainly no larger than the increased probability of observation in the treatment group as a share of the probability of observations the treatment group. Another much simpler way of saying this is “trimming the data by the known proportion of excess individuals” in the treatment group. (To gain bounds on the mean for the inframarginal group which we can then difference from the control-group mean get the treatment effect). Perhaps some intuition for why this improves on the Horwitz model: we don’t need to assume that those observed in the treatment group that wouldn’t have been observed in the control would’ve had the highest possible outcomes. No, we only need to assume (to get the upper bound) that these came from the highest distribution because they had to come from somewhere. These were the people in the upper tail of the relevant group but they couldn’t all have been the individual highest achiever. The model is extended to heterogeneity and heteroscedasticity. This begins with the independence of treatment assignment the “potential sample selection indicators” for either treatment or control, in other words whether that individual will have an observed outcome under treatment and whether that the individual would have an observed outcome under control, and the latent potential outcomes. Experimental or random assignment ensures that each of the potential outcomes (and the correspondence to observability under each treatment) is independent of the actual assigned treatment. The second assumption is monotonicity: treatment assignment can only affect sample selection in one direction. *Some discussion from my own research projects on this … DR: For our (substitution) experiments, it is in fact not clear to me whether this should necessarily be the case, as some (less generous?) people may be induced to leave because of having been asked to donate, while potentially other (more generous people) might be induced to return given that they were asked to donate. (This proposed nonmonotonicity implies that the ‘asked twice’ sample tends to weed out the less generous, which would lead to a bias against substitution, strengthening the case for our result.) DR, aside: However, even though the paper doesn’t say it, I suspect this assumption could be weakened and you would still get some similar bounds. To put it another way, I would imagine that these bounds could be adjusted based on some reasonable ad hoc assumptions about the share of the population who is affected in either direction. – NL: I’m coming to think that our Dutch data problems are more things involving “hurdle models”. Can this technique also be applied to such hurdle models? Next proposition 1a states that given these assumptions we can derive sharp lower and upper bounds for the average treatment effect (conditional on ‘would be observed in both states’). Note that for this estimator if the probability of observation is greater under the treatment we need to trim the treatment groups outcome distribution and if the probability of observation is greater under the control we need to trim the control group’s outcome distribution. DR, aside comment: we seem to be throwing out a bit of the data in these estimates, which would suggest that something more efficient could be generated. (The stated bounds you can estimate are exactly the same as the bounds from the previous specification, at least as I had interpreted the way they would be produced.) Their remark 2 notes that an implication is that as \\(P_0\\), that as the “difference between the relative probability of observation of an outcome under treatment versus control” tends to zero, i.e., as the probability of having an observed outcome (or the conditional probability of this) is the same for treatment and control) then there is no sample selection bias. Their estimate convergences to the estimate he calls an estimate for the “always takers subpopulation… except that taking… is selection into the [outcome-observed] sample.” So, a very vanilla estimator is acceptable if we find the same conditional probability of selection for each group, under monotonicity, which, for this case, we can test (see Remark 4 below). – (DR: To me this suggests that there might be something wrong going on here. Intuitively, If I simply observe the same rate of attrition in the treatment and control groups this shouldn’t be enough to tell me that attrition did not matter, as it could occur differentially for both groups, but it seems to be a result here; this is probably due to the assumption of monotonicity of the selection/observation term, as well as the random/exogenous assignment to each group.) Remark 3 discusses the importance of monotonicity for the bounds, saying this assumption is “minimally sufficient” (I think it would be better to say minimally sufficient for these particular bounds that he computed). To demonstrate this he gives an extreme example. Without monotonicity it could be (note: this would seem like a very unlikely outcome!) that every observation in the control group comes from the population in the treatment group that would not have been observed had they been treated and every observation in the treatment group happens to come from the set of people that would not have been observed had they been in the control group. These two “subpopulations do not overlap, so the difference in the means could not be interpreted as a causal effect.” – DR, aside : there must be some way to impose some restrictions on this even allowing for this non-monotonicity. (He notes that this can be improved upon somewhat by thinking about the total the idea that the total masses of unobserved that would’ve been observed in the other group can’t be greater than the share that is not observed in the other treatment group, but this doesn’t seem like a particularly fruitful route as it in most reasonable cases will still allow for very wide bounds.) Remark 4 suggests that if we can assume (or somehow observe?) that the conditional probabilities of selection are the same for treatment and control, we can test whether monotonicity in fact holds and the simple difference in means will be an appropriate estimate of the treatment effect. Here, the assumption implies that everyone in the treatment or control group would have been observed under the opposite treatment as well. This in fact implies that the distribution of the exogenous variables should be the same in the treatment and control groups conditional on being selected. This seems fairly intuitive, we look at whether selection seems to be occurring in different ways are on different margins for the two groups treatment versus control. Apparently for this test to have power we need that the subpopulations of “noncompliant errors in opposite directions” (quotation mine) must have distinct distributions of baselines exogenous characteristics. If these were the same then whether or not monotonicity holds the test doesn’t tell us anything. – DR: I wonder if anyone uses this test for Monotonicity under non-differential selection? Another relevant note that he bundles in this remark is that the technique here only yields estimates for those who would be with an observed outcome for either treatment or control. One could additionally try to bound this as an estimate for the entire population using the Horwitz and Manski bounds for this latter thing. However, in many contexts there are reasons that the bounded estimates they mainly use are the relevant ones, such as “the impact of the program on wage rates for those whose employment status was not affected by the program.” DR: In our substitution experiment case, the substitution patterns for those for whom attrition was not affected by the first-round-charity treatment @NL: E.g., the impact of an institution on income for those whose choice to remain in the course was not affected by their institutional assignment “Narrowing bounds using covariates” All of the above could be done conditional on a particular set of baseline characteristics such as gender or race. The average treatment effect could be estimated separately for each. (Note: and perhaps combined in a fruitful way?) One can alternately use covariates to reduce the width of these bounds. To give intuition, we can imagine a baseline covariate that perfectly predicts an individual’s wage. Because treatments are randomly assigned the maintained assumptions will still hold conditionally on this X. The results the methods can be applied separately for each value of this covariate, and for each such value the trimming procedure will actually have no impact on the estimate. DR: I think this is the “estimate and sum things up in a weighted way” procedure I thought about a moment ago. Proposition 1B gives the balance estimator for a model involving exogenous variables. Essentially, this computes the corresponding bounds estimator at each X, where the differential selection probability is computed for that particular X, the upper quantile value of the outcome is given conditional on the same X and on being in the treatment group. These are then integrated (or summed up) weighted by the distribution or the cdf of this covariate in the control group. These bounds will necessarily be sharper than the balance without controls. 10.2.1.0.4 Section 4: estimation and inference The asymptotic variance depends on components reflecting the variance of the trimmed distribution, the variance of the estimated trimming threshold, and the variance in the estimate of “how much of the distribution to trim” (the relative selection probability differential). Equation 6 formally defines the estimator Estimated bounds consistent for ‘true bounds’ under standard conditions Two ways to compute CI’s – CI’s for the ‘true bounds’ or CI’s for the TE itself. A 95% CI for the former will contain the latter with even greater probability. Imbens and Manski ‘04 can be used to derive the latter which are ’more apppropriate here’ since the object of interest is the TA and not the ’region of all rationalizable treatment effects. These are built off of a transformation of the estimate UB and LB and max estimated sd of each of these. the latter are reported by the ‘cie’ option in ‘leebounds’ Generalisation to monotonicity (without knowing direction of impact of treatment on selection)… As an overall procedure, it is asymptotically valid to estimate p, and if positive, trim the treatment group and conduct inference as discussed in Subsections 4.1 and 4.2. And if negative… [do similar] though coverage rates for confidence intervals are asymptotically correct, a large discontinuity in the asymptotic variance suggests coverage rates may be inaccurate when sample sizes are small and p0 is “close” to zero … A simple, conservative approach to combining the trimmed and untrimmed intervals is to compute their union 10.2.1.0.5 Section 5: Empirical Results Table 4 gives a step-by-step that is a good way of seeing and understanding the construction of the estimator, and where the ‘action’ is, in treimming, in components of the SE, etc. Intervals are 1/14 the width of the equivalent Horowitz/Manski bounds 10.2.1.0.5.0.1 5.2 using covariates to narrow bounds Any baseline covariate will do, as will any function of all the baseline covariates. In the analysis here, a single baseline covariate—which is meant to be a proxy for the predicted wage potential for each individual—is constructed from a linear combination of all observed baseline characteristics. This single covariate is then discretized, so that effectively five groups are formed according to whether the predicted wage is within intervals defined by $6·75, $7, $7·50, and $8·50. (Substitution): this is essentially what I propose we do, but using Ridge Regressions or something similar To compute the bounds for the overall average…the group-specific bounds must be averaged, weighted by the proportion (sPr Group J|S0=1,S1=1) The estimated asymptotic variance for these overall averages is the sum of (1) a weighted average of the group-specific variances and (2) the (weighted-) mean squared deviation of the group-specific estimates from the overall mean. This second term takes into account the sampling variability of the weights \\(\\rightarrow\\) result: 11% narrower bounds Interesting; possibly do similar for @NL-ed: By statistically ruling out any effect more negative than −0·037, this suggests that after 4 years, the Job Corps enabled program group members to offset at least 35% (and perhaps more) of the potential 0·058 loss in wages due to lost labour market experience that could have been caused by the program 10.2.1.1 Section 6: Conclusions: implications and applications Interesting intuitive argument: Another reason to interpret the evidence as pointing to positive wage effects is that the lower bound is based on an extreme and unintuitive assumption—that wage outcomes are perfectly negatively correlated with the propensity to be employed. From a purely theoretical standpoint, a simple labour supply model suggests that, all other things equal, those on the margin of being employed will have lowest wages not the highest wages (i.e., the “reservation wage” will be the smallest wage that draws the individual into the labour force). In addition, the empirical evidence in Table 2 suggests that there is positive selection into employment: those who are predicted to have higher wages are more likely to be employed (i.e., U and V are positively correlated). If this is true, it seems relatively more plausible to trim the lower rather than the upper tail of the distribution to get an estimate of the treatment effect.

A probability-based survey sample is created by constructing a list of the target population, called the sampling frame, a randomized process for selecting units from the sample frame, called a selection procedure, and a method of contacting selected units to enable them to complete the survey, called a data collection method or mode (lookup in Wiki) Note that the ‘sampling frame’, ‘the source material or device from which a sample is drawn’, e.g, a telephone directory, may not exactly contain all elements of the ‘population of interest’ (e.g., the population with and without listed numbers). See ‘Missing elements’, ‘Foreign elements’, ‘Duplicate entries’ and ‘Groups or clusters’ … Also note that ‘Not all frames explicitly list population elements; some list only ’clusters’. For example, a street map can be used as a frame for a door-to-door survey.’ Simple random versus stratified and cluster sampling Issues* Many of these also seem relevant for our ‘social movement’ case of interest below. Non-response bias (biggest issue?) 11.1.2 Non-probability sampling 11.2 Case: Surveying an unmeasured and rare population surrounding a ‘social movement’ Background and setup Consider a case where: We have a population-of-interest based on an affiliation, certain actions, or a set of ideas. Some examples: Vegetarians ‘Tea party conservatives’ in the US Jews, both religious and ‘culturally Jewish’ Jazz musicians For this writeup, we will call the targeted group ‘the Jazz Movement’ or ‘the Jazz population’. Individuals will either be ‘Jazzy’ (J) or ‘non-Jazzy’ (NJ). There are some disagreements about how to define this group. We have no ‘gold standard’ to benchmark against. There is no ‘actual targeted and measured outcome’ such as voting in an election. There are no other surveys or enumerations (e.g., Censuses) to inform our results. We have collected survey responses from self-selected ‘convenience’ samples (=‘internet surveys’?) across several years … based on advertising and word-of-mouth in a variety of outlets (‘referrers’) associated with the ‘movement’. Particularly: A discussion forum A newsletter A popular website and hub for the movement We can identify which ‘referrer’ lead someone to our survey. All participants are given a similar ‘donation’ incentive, an incentive that might tend to particularly attract members of the Movement. Given the context, we might reasonably expect that willingness to complete the survey might be associated with depth of support for the movement. We can link some individuals across years. Some questions repeat across years. We have (self-reported) measures of Demographics (age, gender, etc), Attitudes and beliefs (e.g., support for the death penalty), Retrospectives (esp. ‘year you became Jazzy’), and Behaviors (e.g., charitable donations). Our research goals include measuring: The size of the movement (challenging), The demographics (and psychographics, etc) of the movement, The attitudes, beliefs and behaviors of people in the movement, The (causal) drivers of joining the movement and actively participating in the movement (or leaving the movement), … and the trends/changes in all of the above. Why do we care? We want to know these things for several reasons, including… To find ways to build membership (perhaps ‘expand and diversify’) and participation in the movement (including specific behaviors like donating),especially through… Funding causal drivers that ‘work’, and Profiling and targeting ‘likely Jazzers’ from outside the movement To understand and better represent the attitudes of the movement’s members in our movement-wide activities. ‘For general understanding of the movement and its members’, to inform a wide range of decisions across the movement, and further research into the movement. 11.2.1 Our ‘convenience’ method; issues, alternatives Our current approach seems to be some combination of what is called ‘convenience sampling’ and ‘snowball sampling’. The major distinction from probability sampling (as I see it) is… Probability sampling identifies a population of interest and a sample frame meant to capture this population. Rather than appealing to this entire population/frame, PS randomly (or stratified/clustered) samples a ‘probability share’ (e.g., 1/1000) from this frame. Selected participants are (hopefully) given strong incentives to complete the survey. One can carefully analyze —and perhaps adjust for—the rate of non-response. In contrast, I have heard that ‘internet surveys’, if done right, with proper adjustments, are seen as increasingly reliable, especially in the context of electoral polling. Is our approach similar enough to this to be able to adopt these approaches. Wikipedia entry on ‘convenience sampling’ Another example would be a gaming company that wants to know how one of their games is doing in the market one day after its release. Its analyst may choose to create an online survey on Facebook to rate that game. Bias The results of the convenience sampling cannot be generalized to the target population because of the potential bias of the sampling technique due to under-representation of subgroups in the sample in comparison to the population of interest. The bias of the sample cannot be measured. Therefore, inferences based on the convenience sampling should be made only about the sample itself.[9] (Wikipedia, on ‘Convenience sampling’, cites Borenstein et al, 2017) This statement is deeply pessimistic… ‘the bias cannot be measured’. We might dig more deeply to see if there are potential approaches to dealing with this 11.2.2 Notes and considerations: ‘Whether we can do better’ sort of questions … we should try to pin down what our metrics and targets are What do we mean when we say the ‘actual Jazz population’? What sorts of questions/claims are we interested in most/what ‘parameters’ are we trying to measure? For the second point, I think that some methods might yield plausibly unbiased/reliable estimates of certain parameters (e.g., year-to-year changes) but not others. Moss: some flexibility/two-way interaction here in that we have a lot of different goals with the survey (i.e. different kinds of questions being posed) and depending on the answers you discern, we might give up on some of these questions and focus on others "],["why-experiment-design.html", "12 (Experimental) Study design: Identifying meaningful and useful (causal) relationships and parameters 12.1 Why run an experiment or study? 12.2 Causal channels and identification 12.3 Types of experiments, ‘demand effects’ and more artifacts of artifical setups 12.4 Generalizability (and heterogeneity)", " 12 (Experimental) Study design: Identifying meaningful and useful (causal) relationships and parameters 12.1 Why run an experiment or study? I claim an experiment should: Have a reasonable chance of an outcome that would not have been predicted in advance. The realized outcome should meaningfully inform our understanding of the world in other words. In other words, if the outcome comes out one way it should cause us to update our beliefs about a particular hypothesis about the world in one direction (and if it comes out the other way we should update in the other direction.)

This paper is a critique of how models are claimed to be “tested”, through a literal implementation, in the laboratory. They argue this misinterprets the intention of a model, and use of economic modelling in general. Ultimately, such experiments (they say) don’t really tell us one way or another about the truth or usefulness of the model for the real-world domain that was intended. Some key quotes.. My reductio ad absurdum on this is an experimenter who ‘tests mechanism-design’ by asking subjects “do you want to choose this optimal mechanism and earn £20, or this inefficient mechanism and earn £10”? – givingtools on twitter They single-out two examples of well-published experiments for criticism: \"an investigation of price dispersion by John Morgan, Henrik Orzen and Martin Sefton (2006), and an investigation of information cascades by Lisa Anderson and Charles Holt (1997)\"… In each case, the experimenters create a laboratory environment that closely resembles the model itself. The only important difference between the experiment and the model is that, whereas the model world contains imaginary agents who act according to certain principles of rational choice, the laboratory contains real human beings who are free to act as they wish. The decision problems that the human subjects face are exactly the problems specified by the model. We argue that such an experiment is not, in any useful sense, a test of what the model purports to say about the target domain. Instead, it is a test of those principles of rational choice that the modeller has attributed to the model world. Those principles are not specific to that model; they are generic theoretical components that are used in many economic models across a wide range of applications. Surprisingly, these doubts are not expressed in terms of the applicability of MSNE [mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium] to the model’s target domain, pricing decisions by retail firms. The doubts are about whether experimental subjects will act according to MSNE when placed in a laboratory environment that reproduces the main features of the model. If one takes the viewpoint of the subjects themselves, there seems to be very little resemblance between the decision problems they face and those by which retail firms set their prices. The connection between the two is given by the model: the subjects’ decision problems are like those of the firms in the model, and the firms in the model are supposed to represent firms in the world. However, MOS are no more concrete than Varian in explaining how the comparative-static properties of the model relate to the real world of retail pricing. The suggestion in these passages is that the clearinghouse model’s claim to be informative about the world is strengthened if its results are confirmed in the laboratory. In this sense the experiment is informative about the world. But the experiment itself is a test of the model, not of what the model says about the world. The procedure of random and anonymous rematching of subjects is explained as a means of eliminating ‘unintended repeated game effects’, such as tacit collusion among sellers (pp. 142–3). This argument illustrates how tightly the laboratory environment is being configured to match the model. In a test of MSNE, repeated game effects are indeed a source of contamination; and MSNE is a property of Varian’s model. But in the target domain of retail trade, the same firms interact repeatedly in the same markets, with opportunities for tacit collusion. Clearly, if an experiment implemented a model in its entirety, all that it could test would be the mathematical validity of the model’s results. Provided one were confident in the modeller’s mathematics, experimental testing would be pointless. Thus, when an experiment implements almost every feature of a model, all it can test in addition to mathematical validity are those features that have not been implemented. Thus, the experiment is a test of MSNE in a specific class of games. [emphasis added] MSNE is what we will call a generic component of economic models – a piece of ready-to-use theory which economists insert into models with disparate target domain ibid Relating back to the discussion of the different conceptions of theory: Is it informative at all to run experimental tests of theoretical principles such as MSNE and Bayesian rationality, viewed as generic components of economic models? … A strict instrumentalist (taking a position that is often attributed to Friedman) might answer ‘No’ to the first question, on the grounds that tests should be directed only at the predictions of theories and not at their assumptions. Such an experimental design should not be appraised in terms of what the model purports to say about its target domain. It should be appraised in terms of what it can tell us about the relevant generic component, considered generically. When (as in the cases of MSNE and Bayesian rationality) the same theoretical component appears in many different models, an experimenter can afford to be selective in looking for a suitable design for a test Considered simply as a test of MSNE, MOS’s experiment uses extraordinarily complicated games. Many of the canonical experiments in game theory use 2×2 games. Depending on the treatment, MOS’s games are either 101×101 (for two players) or 101×101×101×101 (for four players). Payoffs to combinations of strategies are determined by a formula which, although perhaps intuitive to an economist (it replicates the demand conditions of the clearinghouse model), might not be easy for a typical subject to grasp. 12.2 Causal channels and identification Ruling out alternative hypotheses, etc 12.3 Types of experiments, ‘demand effects’ and more artifacts of artifical setups 12.4 Generalizability (and heterogeneity) “But all the other papers do it!” A common response to critiques (particularly critiques of the generalizability of experimental work) is that “all the other papers have the same problem” and that excepting this critique would require rejecting all previous work too. In politics this has been referred to as “what-about-ism”. You can guess that I’m not a fan of this. I think one always needs to defend the paper and approach on its own merits. Generalisability is an important issue. Each of the other published papers that also suffers from such issues has a specific response and justification for that particular case, and if it doesn’t this is sorely lacking. I think we should be reading and publishing papers that consider, discuss, and acknowledge their own limitations, and future work can test and build on this. This should promote to robust, reproducable science. Just because I say “this is something we should be concerned with” doesn’t mean I’m saying “this paper has no value’. I just mean”let’s discuss reasons why this may or may not threaten internal or external validity/generalisability, and how we can design the study and analysis minimise these potential problems\"\" In writing a paper, I find it important that we the authors feel the results are credible and not overstated. So I feel like the best approach is “let’s write the best paper we can and consider every issue seriously, and then hopefully the good publication/peer-review outcome will follow”. That’s also the most motivating and least stressful way for me to work. (Rather than thinking ‘how can I sneak this paper into the best journal?’) In fact I consider peer review and rating as the important outcome, not the publication itself. We live in a world where anyone can publish their work immediately on the WWW. The journals themselves are providing little or no service: it is the reviewers and editors offering feedback and evaluation that matters. A thought: Replace reviews (accept/reject/R&amp;R) with ratings (0-10)?

I think it could solve some of the p-hacking problems but not much else. How to not relegate exploratory analyses too far is also unclear to me. DR: I’m much more on the ‘pro’ side pre-registration and PaPs. It also helps deal with publication bias and file drawers. And p-hacking is a huge issue IMHO. But it is also good to have some consideration of the pros and cons, so this would be great. BB: RE pre-reg: yes I think it is enough that it prevents p-hacking (there could be very little cost associated with pre-reg) but I fear that it could prevent other advancements if it relegates exploratory analyses too far. DR: I don’t think it should be binary. Systems need to be worked out for adjustments to the meaning of reported estimates depending on whether they were or were not preregistered, and how many were preregistered. While reported significance levels could be adjusted in the frequentist framework, this will all presumably based on measures of the likelihood that such a result would have been estimated/reported. Thus I think this could most easily be incorporated into a Bayesian framework but I’m not saying it would be easy. Still, they have done some good work on adjustments for ‘sequential designs’. BB: I think that it could also stifle students a bit – it may reduce further the number of students who have access to funding that allows for experiments that will be able to be published if all experiments have to be high-powered. DR: Statistical power is an important issue. I was skeptical at first about the ‘dangers of underpowered studies’ but maybe I’m coming around a bit. My thinking was that ‘we can simply make downward adjustments to the estimates reported in underpowered studies’. See the discussion under power calculations. Anyways, we don’t want to put the cart before the horse: as Gelman said at a conference we should be supporting science not the careers of scientists. I tend to think there are strong arguments for more centralization in social science. And my impression is that we actually have too many different studies and distinct research programs being run, and too many papers being published and not carefully brought together into a framework. Going through the studies on the https://www.replicationmarkets.com/ reinforces this impression for me. Still, I think there are ways around this to enable early career people. ‘Underpowered’ experiments could be registered as part of a longer/sequential research program, perhaps collaborative and enabling meta-analysis. BB: I also don’t think it gets at publication bias very much unless pre-reg’ed studies are followed up on. Only then do you know why the study didn’t come out – and quite a lot of the time I think it will be attrition/inability to gather the necessary data. Someone could launch that journal though – the Journal of Failed Studies – to have a place for a record that they have been run and what happened to be kept. So I am pro pre-reg, I just think the system needs a bit of work. DR: If preregistration is made public and well-organize, then the ‘failed’ exercises willtbe integrated into future meta-analyses; so that’s at least a partial solution here. Agreed, we need to build better systems for incentivising pre-registration and careful data sharing. We need to give career credit to people for planning designing and reporting credible experiments and projects, even if they ‘fail’. Part this is publishing/rewarding tight null results, which actually do add a lot of value. We might also consider offering some reward careerwise to experiments that fail – in terms of being deeply inconclusive– for some arbitrary or random reason even though they were well-planned and executed. But I think it is hard to get the incentives right for the latter. 13.1.2 The hazards of specification-searching 13.2 Sequential and adaptive designs Needs to adjust significance tests for augmenting data/sequential analysis/peeking Statistics/econometrics new-statistics sagarin_2014 http://www.paugmented.com/ resubmit_letterJpube.tex, http://andrewgelman.com/2014/02/13/stopping-rules-bayesian-analysis/ Yet … \\(P_{augmented}\\) may overstate type-1 error rate Statistics/econometrics response to referees, new-statistics \" A process involving stopping “whenever the nominal \\(p &lt; 0.05\\)” and gathering more data otherwise (even rarely) must yield a type-1 error rate above 5%. Even if the subsequent data suggested a “one in a million chance of arising under the null” the overall process yields a 5%+ error rate. The NHST frequentist framework can not adjust ex-post to consider the “likelihood of the null hypothesis” given the observed data, in light of the shocking one-in-a-million result. While Bayesian approaches can address this, we are not highly familiar with these methods; however, we are willing to pursue this if you feel it is appropriate. Considering the calculations in , it is clear that \\(p_{augmented}\\) should the type-1 error of the process if there is a positive probability that after an initial experiment attains p\\(&lt;0.05\\), more data is collected. A headline \\(p&lt;0.05\\) does imply that this result will enter the published record. Referees may be skeptical of other parts of the design or framework or motivation. They may also choose to reject the paper specifically because of this issue; they believe the author would have continued collecting data had the result yielded \\(p&gt;0.05\\), thus they think it is better to demand more evidence or a more stringent critical value. Prompted by the referee, the author may collect more data even though \\(p&lt;0.05\\). Or, she may decide to collect more data even without a referee report/rejection demanding it, for various reasons (as we did after our Valentine’s experiment). Thus, we might imagine that there is some probability that after (e.g.) an initial experiment attaining p&lt;0.05, more data is collected, implying that \\(p_{augmented}\\) as calculated above overstates the type I error rate that would arise from these practices. As referees and editors, we should be concerned about the status of knowledge as accepted by the profession, i.e., in published papers. If we recognize the possibility of data augmentation after any paper is rejected, it might be a better practice to require a significance standard substantially below \\(p=0.05\\), in order to attain a type-1 error rate of 5% or less in our published corpus.\" 13.3 Efficient assignment of treatments (Links back to power analyses) 13.3.1 See also multiple hypothesis testing 13.3.2 How many treatment arms can you ‘afford’? 13.3.3 Other notes and resources ICYMI:Recording of my talk on experimental design in the Chamberlain seminar, with discussions by dmckenzie001 and Max Tabord-Meehan:https://t.co/xKtTrH8X1U https://t.co/e7Cq90D6Sl — Maximilian Kasy (maxkasy) May 25, 2020 "],["power.html", "14 (Experimental) Study design: (Ex-ante) Power calculations 14.1 What sort of ‘power calculations’ make sense, and what is the point? 14.2 Key ingredients necessary for doing a power analysis(and designing a study in light of this) 14.3 The ‘harm to science’ from running underpowered studies 14.4 Power calculations without real data 14.5 Power calculations using prior data", " 14 (Experimental) Study design: (Ex-ante) Power calculations The ‘statistical power’ of an analysis is the probability that this analysis diagnoses that ‘an effect is present’ (or a parameter is nonzero).

There are several reasons to consider power and to do ‘power calculations’ in advance of running an experiment or doing an analysis. An ‘underpowered study’, one with a low likelihood of diagnosing a ‘substantial’ effect is present when it is present, is also likely to be an uninformative study. If ‘rejecting a particular null hypothesis’ is important (and please see McElreath and other’s discussion about the follies of the ways NHST is used in science on this point), an underpowered test is unlikely to reject this null hypothesis even when it is ‘meaningfully false’. Perhaps more importantly, an underpowered study is likely to yield wide ‘confidence intervals’ (or wide ‘posterior Bayesian credible intervals’). Simply put, after an underpowered study (at least in isolation), we still won’t have a good sense of what the true value is. 14.1.1 Why do a power analysis? What are the practical benefits of doing a power analysis Considering the cost/benefits of ‘more data’ to determine ‘how much to collect’ Consider and optimise over the tradeoffs in design choices … e.g., introducing more treatments usually involves a loss of power ‘Can I have enough funds to gather enough data to make it worth doing a study?’ If I am trying to do some sort of replication exercise to diagnose the credibility of previous work I want to ‘have power to do this credibly’ (I’m not sure about this one) Avoiding the general harm ‘underpowered studies’. There are arguments that individual ‘underpowered’ studies may undermine science, particular in conjunction with ‘publication bias’. An ex-ante power analysis might (I’m not sure on this one, it seems possibly dubious) be useful in making ex-post statements about null effects 14.2 Key ingredients necessary for doing a power analysis(and designing a study in light of this) Our assumptions (or existing prior data used for simulations) over the data-generating-process … in particular, what do we expect the distribution of the outcomes to look like, and with what dispersion? The nature of the sampling or assignment to experimental treatments The specific proposed statistical test (or procedure) to be used Perhaps the most important and debated ingredient: What ‘metrics of power and effect size’ are we considering, and what are our targets? Are we simply seeking ‘precise estimates’, estimates with small confidence/credible intervals? If so, how precise, and how do we measure this precision? Do we seek power to detect some ‘minimal effect size of interest’? If so, what is this ‘MESOI’? Note that there is (often? always?) a mathematical equivalency between the confidence interval and the standard ‘power to detect X’ criteria. Another criterion might be ‘power to do an equivalency test’… but I need to learn more about this. Considering: ‘should I use a function of previous estimated effect sizes to determine the MESOI’? From David Moss (unfold) Moss: … not basing power calculations on previously observed effect sizes? Lakens uses the SESOI approach, which we often do, but SESOI can be specified based on the effect sizes previous found in the literature though obviously there’s a bunch of ways to do it Moss, citing Lakens: … use earlier work to decide which effect sizes are deemed to be ‘meaningful’, with particular specific recommendations: Subjective justification of a smallest effect size of interest … Second, the SESOI can be based on related studies in the literature. Ideally, researchers who publish novel research would always specify their SESOI, but this is not yet common practice. It is thus up to researchers who build on earlier work to decide which effect size is too small to be meaningful when they examine the same hypothesis. Simonsohn (2015) recently proposed setting the SESOI as the effect size that an earlier study would have had 33% power to detect. With this small-telescopes approach, the equivalence bounds are thus primarily based on the sample size in the original study. For example, consider a study in which 100 participants answered a question, and the results were analyzed with a one-sample t test. A two-sided test with an alpha of .05 would have had 33% power to detect an effect of d = 0.15. Another example of how previous research can be used to determine the SESOI can be found in Kordsmeyer and Penke (2017), who based the SESOI on the mean of effect sizes reported in the literature. Thus, in their replication study, they tested whether they could reject effects at least as extreme as the average reported in the literature. Given random variation and bias in the literature, a more conservative approach could be to use the lower end of a confidence interval around the meta-analytic estimate of the effect size (cf. Perugini, Gallucci, &amp; Costantini, 2014). Another justifiable option when choosing the SESOI on the basis of earlier work is to use the smallest observed effect size that could have been statistically significant in a previous study. In other words, the researcher decides that effects that could not have yielded a p less than \\(\\alpha\\) in an original study will not be considered meaningful in the replication study either, even if those effects are found to be statistically significant in the replication study. The assumption here is that the original authors were interested in observing a significant effect, and thus were not interested in observed effect sizes that could not have yielded a significant result. It might be likely that the original authors did not consider which effect sizes their study had good statistical power to detect, or that they were interested in smaller effects but gambled on observing an especially large effect in the sample purely as a result of random variation. Even then, when building on earlier research that does not specify a SESOI, a justifiable starting point might be to set the SESOI to the largest effect size that, when observed in the original study, would not have been statistically significant. DR response: Why do we assume previous authors considered MESOI? I’m missing the logic in the quotes above as to “why the previously detected affects, or some bounds on these should represent the minimum effect size of interest”? Perhaps there is some justification in “assuming that previous authors have powered their study correctly to detect such a minimum affects”, But to me this just seems like kicking the can down the road and I do not assume this in general. We know that people run under powered studies all the time (see the previous discussion on the harm to science) DR: A second reason why one might see that as the “minimum effect size of interest” simply has to do with being able to publish a paper that can in some way “refute” previous claimed findings. But that is flawed, in my view, as a way of doing science. We should power the study that is most informative, either by itself, or when made part of a meta analysis. I don’t see the value of this adversarial back-and-forth approach. DR preferred approach - power a study based on policy concerns, also considering it’s use in meta-analysis. One basic argument is: I want to power a study as a practical goal based on my policy concerns. Typically the value of the study will depend on how precisely you are able to estimate and “bound” a parameter. (This may be expressed as a conference interval or a credible interval if we are thinking of a Bayesian posterior). So, in determining how much power I wish to achieve, I need to weigh the benefits of this precision against the cost of a larger sample size. This is a very different considerations from “what power do I have to detect that a previously estimated effect size, if true, is ‘statistically significant’” (By the standard definition). Of course “We should power” is subject to constraints and cost concerns. So, when I am designing the study I am almost never able to have the power I want for all possible tests/hypotheses. Where these considerations come into play, is whether to decide to run the study now or wait to get more funding, and in considering which hypotheses to test and which treatments to put in the study, et cetera 14.3 The ‘harm to science’ from running underpowered studies \"One worries about underpowered tests. Your result (may have) relatively large effect sizes that are still insignificant, which makes me wonder whether it has low power. Low powered studies undermine the reliability of our results. - From an anonymous referee report Perhaps most of us consider power largely in thinking about “Is our analysis going to be fruitful for ourselves as researchers?” and perhaps also, where we find a null result… “Is the analysis powerful enough to plausibly rule out an effect of a meaningful size?” The conventional wisdom has been that, at least for papers reporting non-null effects, running a low-power study is mostly done at the authors’ own peril. We might think “if I am lucky enough to observe a strong effect in an low-powered study then I have managed to mine a vein of truth on a relatively unproductive plot, and have thus earned my reward.” However (Button et al. 2013) point out that running lower-powered studies reduces the positive predicted value—the probability that a “positive” research finding reflects a true effect—of a typical study reported to find a statistically significant result. In combination with publication bias, this could lead a large rate of type-1 error in our body of scientific knowledge (false-positive cases, where the true effect was null and the authors had a very “lucky” draw). True non-null effects will be underrepresented, as underpowered tests will too-often fail to detect (and publish) these. Furthermore, in both cases (true null, true non-null), underpowered tests will be far more likely to find a significant result when they have a random draw that estimates an effect size substantially larger than the true effect size. Thus, the published evidence base will tend to overstate the size of effects. DR: However, I speculate that this idea might be less clear-cut than it seems. E.g., if we consider a (“non-sparse”) world where every factor indeed has an effect, lower powered studies are more likely to detect effects that are truly larger, which are arguably more policy-relevant; moreover, overstated effect sizes might be adjusted with a standard correction. Ferraro discussion on magnitude error due to underpowered studies: {-} … if you are looking at an under-powered design then sure, you might pick up a significant result which is actually spurious. But on top of that even if there is a genuine effect there, the effect that you actually pick up as being significant will (likely) be overestimated. The intuition behind that result is (I think) that for an effect to be picked up in a study then it has to be large enough to overcome the issue that you face with power. Low-powered studies can only detect really large effects, and so the large effect you pick up in such a study could be genuine, but it equally could be a poorly-estimated coefficient. By using a low powered study you sift through for these kind of effects. 14.4 Power calculations without real data R ‘Paramtest’ package vignette is helpful here. 14.5 Power calculations using prior data Adapt example in ‘scopingwork.Rmd’ to this 14.5.1 From Reinstein upcoming experiment preregistration We are searching for a design and sample size that has sufficient power to detect (or ‘statistically rule out’) an effect of ‘minimal interest’ size, given our somewhat-limited budget. The ‘design parameters’ we can play with are given above. While conventional practice seems to involve completely simulated data based on parametric assumptions (normality, etc) we prefer to draw from comparable ‘untreated’ real-world data (see (Barrios 2014) for a related discussion). Assuming the general distribution of outcomes (and covariates) is in some sense constant or predictable over time (perhaps stationarity?), this should give us more accurate estimates of power. We will consider each design’s power to detect particular ‘treatment effects’ (of a minimum relevant size) on particular outcomes, which may be linear, proportional, or otherwise. Our calculations do not depend on any assumptions over the ‘true treatment effect’. Assignment procedures to consider We consider three categories of possible assignment criteria: (We are coding these below.) 1. Simple data-based (Coded here) Here we imagine a very simple dynamic assignment to treatments with alternation (or repeated from an urn with one ball per treatment, refilling the urn once empty). This procedure will essentially guarantee an equal share of observations in each treatment. We will also consider an unbalanced design, both in this and in other categories, which may achieve greater power, especially considering the differential costs of our treatments. Although as we have no evidence on the treatments and thus no reason to anticipate a differential variance between treatments and control, an unbalanced design may allow greater power for the same cost, as observing controls is costless, and the ‘low-donation’ treatment is lower cost. 2. Ad-hoc (Reinstein adapts Barrios), using prediction.Rmd quantiles General summary: Fit a predictive model of the outcome (total donations) based on pre-treatment observables, using set-aside training data. Generate quantiles of ‘predicted donation’ (tuning parameter=number of quantiles?). Power-test block randomisation with these blocks as quantiles, using set-aside testing data. Caveats: If we test the power with multiple models on the test data (e.g., ‘tuning’ the number of quantiles) we will be overly optimistic and maybe overfitting. Also, this assignment procedure is not necessarily robust to TE heterogeneity. By luck, it may assign substantial imbalance across any particular dimension. Prediction algorithm (folded) Adapt from code in CharitySubstitutionExperiment repo, in assignments_power.Rmd and analysis_subst.Rmd; examples of Elastic net etc Define and organize the set of variables available at intervention Define and calculate the outcome variables (total amount raised) Split and set-aside validation and simulation data (?within prediction also) Model the outcome, using a Ridge regression with all features. The regularization/penalty parameter could be optimized for best fit. (Cross-fold). Blocking process (folded) We can test block randomization by the predicted quantile of this model with a bootstrapped procedure using set-aside ‘testing’ data not used in the above regression. We want to run the simulations until we find the optimal “block width” or quantile to use for blocking the randomization. Ideally, this procedure should take into account the fact that if we stopped at a random time we may have uneven cell sizes. (Caveat – this resampling may need to be done based a randomised ‘start time’ to address random time-specific effects. ) Note: Because of this and for feasibility, we may abridge step 5, and just try out a few reasonable large block widths (e.g., quartiles) Probably the way to do this is, for each proposed block width (e.g., quartiles, deciles, 15 bins, etc) we draw random samples from the set-aside data according to this procedure, and estimate an “effect size” for each sample. We then consider the 99% bounds of these simulated effect sizes. The block width (and regularization parameter?) that consistently gives us the tightest bounds should be the one that allows us the greatest power to rule out an effect of a certain size, given the null hypothesis of no treatment effect. The intuition: The smaller the largest difference in mean total donations (between treatment and control) that occurs by chance in 99% of draws… the smaller the actual effect that we will be powered to detect (able to judged as statistically significant a reasonable share of the time). [Note: these latter notes may bot go with the procedure proposed below; these are older.] Kasy method? We may or may not get to considering the method proposed in Kasy (2016). It is ideal for Bayesian approaches to policy, but it may make frequentist inference difficult (?). (See steps/notes folded below.)

Maybe cheaper to implement and more valid in the presence of interactions between units within but not across clusters. 15.7.5 The analysis of Completely randomized experiments Aside: see the limitations of the Fisher test when not considering a lady tasting tea (known shares of outcomes). One response: a Bayesian approach Exact p-values for sharp null hypotheses (Fisher etc) “Sharp”: “Under which we can an for all the missing potential outcomes from the observed data” … So we can infer the distribution of any statistics under the Null. E.g., \\(H0\\), The treatment has no effect \\(Y_i(0)=Y_i(1)\\forall i\\), vs \\(Ha\\), At least one unit i has \\(Y_i(0)\\neq Y_i(1)\\) Difference in means by treatment status: Calculate the probability over the randomization distribution of a value with as large an absolute value as the one observed given the actual assignments. This is done by reassigning what we call the “treatments” to all possible combinations (keeping the number of treated units constant) and calculating the “placebo” treatment effect. Calculate the fraction of assignment vectors with statistic at least as large (in absolute value) as the observed one. DR: What is the statistic called and is there preprogrammed code? Is it the Fisher’s exact test? Can do for means or means of the ranks by treatment status (rank sum?) or any stat. Latter is less sensitive to outliers and thick-tailed distributions With multiple outcomes, multiple comparisons issues Use statistics it takes into account all the outcomes (e.g., F-stat, calculate exact P value using the ‘Fisher randomization distribution’ as in Young, ’16) Or use adjustments to P values e.g., Bonferroni or tighter bounds (Which are still more conservative than the Fisher thing); Romano ea survey (2010) Rosenbaum ’92 on estimating treatment effects based on rank statistics (DR: I don’t get this at all) 15.7.6 Randomization inference for Average treatment effects Neyman wanted to estimate the ATE for the sample at hand \\[\\tau=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1..N}{(Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)i)}=\\bar{Y}(1)-\\bar{Y}(0)\\] DR: Again, this is really not what we care about particularly not in a small-scale experiment. Proposed the estimator “Difference in average outcomes by treatment status” (DR: Same as in last section) Defining \\(D_i\\), a term representing “assignment minus the average assignment” Allows a restatement of the estimator which makes it clear that this is unbiased for the average treatment effect \\(\\tau\\) \\[\\hat{i\\tau}=\\tau+\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1..N}{(D_i(\\frac{N}{N_t}Y_i(1)+\\frac{N}{N_c}Y_i(0)}\\] Sampling variance of \\(\\hat{\\tau}\\) over the randomization distribution decomposed as \\[V({\\hat{\\tau})=\\frac{S_c^2}{N_c}+\\frac{S_t^2}{N_t}-\\frac{S_{tc}^2}{N}\\] Where \\(S_c^2\\) and \\(S_t^2\\) Are the variances of the control and treated outcomes, and \\(S_{tc}^2\\) is the variance of the unit level treatment effect (DR: This must be related to the covariance) We can estimate rhe first two terms but not the latter term as we have no observations with both a control and a treatment. In practice researchers ignore the third term, which leads to an upward bias for the sample treatment effect but an unbiased estimator of the population ATE DR: Any intuition for this? We still need to make large sample approximations to construct confidence intervals for the ATE. DR: Does this yield any practical strategy for us to use? 15.7.7 Quantile treatment effect (Infinite population context) Usefulness: Uncover “Treatment effects in the tails” Results robust to thick tails S-th quantile treatment effect defined as the difference in quantiles between the \\(Y_i(1)\\) and\\(Y_i(0)\\) distributions: \\[\\tau_s=q_{Y(1)}(s)-q_{Y(0)}(s)\\] … this is distinct from the “quantile of the differences”: \\(q_{Y(1)-Y(0)}(s)\\), which is in general not identified DR: the letter is truly more interesting; we care about the distribution of the impact of the treatment and not so much about the impact of the treatment on the distribution of outcomes. the two are equal if there is “perfect rank correlation between the two potential outcomes” (DR: I think this simply means that the unit ranked n’th if not treated would also be the unit ranked n’th if treated … no crossing over). Making lemonade: they argue here that the (identifiable) difference in quantiles would be more interesting to a policymaker considering exposing all units to the treatment … (DR: presumably because she should not care who get the particular outcome but only about the distribution of outcomes, a common axiom for social welfare functions). Estimates and tests: use the difference in quantiles as a statistic in and exact P value computation … results for such exact tests are quite different than those based on estimated effects and standard errors because “Quantile estimates are far from normally distributed.” 15.7.8 Covariates (if not stratified) in completely randomized experiments (They strongly recommend stratifying instead of ex post controls.) Why use controls if a simple difference in means is unbiased for the ATE? “incorporating covariates may make analyses more informative” (greater precision) Can incorporate covariates in exact P value analysis, or estimate average treatment effects within subpopulations and average these up appropriately DR: How to do these things in practice? correcting for compromised randomization … which may occur because of missing data and selective attrition They give an example with the data from Lalonde where they estimate the average treatment effect for two groups those with and without prior earnings. They then add these up weighted by the estimated probability of being in each group. DR: I understand this correctly, as they do not define all variables also, how do they compute the standard error of the combined estimator here?! this seems more like an interaction than a standard control here, which would allow a different intercept (control outcome) but not a different treatment effect. ? se of \\[\\hat{p}(\\bar{Y}_t|Y^{t-1}=0-\\bar{Y}_c|Y^{t-1}=0)+(1-\\hat{p})(\\bar{Y}_t|Y^{t-1}=1-\\bar{Y}_c|Y^{t-1}=1)\\] DR: I think there is a simple formula for difference in means that could be applied to this 15.7.9 Randomization inference and regression estimators They urge caution in using reg. “Since randomization does not justify the models, almost anything can happen” (Freedman 08) But using only “indicator variables based on partitioning the covariate space” preserves many of the finite simple properties of simple comparisons of means. Regression estimators for average treatment effects With a single variable, the least-squares estimate of \\(\\tau\\) is identical to the simple difference in means: \\[\\hat{tau}_{ols} = \\bar{Y^o}_t - \\bar{Y}^o_c\\] The intercept is the control value of course: \\(\\hat{\\alpha}_{ols}=\\bar{Y}^o-\\hat{\\tau_{ols}}\\bar{W}=\\bar{Y^0}_c\\). Conceptually important: the unbiasedness claim in the Neyman analysis is conceptually different from the one in conventional regression analysis: in the first case the repeated sampling paradigm keeps the potential outcomes fixed and varies the assignments, whereas in the latter the realized outcomes and assignments are fixed but different units with different residuals, but the same treatment status, are sampled. Redefining the residual in randomisation-based inference terms Now the error term has a clear meaning as the difference between potential outcomes and their population expectation [DR: I think they mean the expectation conditional on treatment] The randomization implies that the average residuals for treated and control units are zero … DR: They mean it implies mean independence (?) but not full independence, heteroskedasticity still likely Because the general robust variance estimator has no natural degrees-of-freedom adjustment [DR: ??], these standard [Randomisation-based?] robust variance estimators differs slightly from the Neyman unbiased variance estimator \\(\\hat{V}_{neyman}\\) \\(\\hat{V}_{robust} =\\frac{s^2_c}{N_c}\\frac{N_c-1}{N_c}+\\frac{s^2_t}{N_t}\\frac{N_t-1}{N_t}\\) Compared to the previously stated estimator for the TE variance for the sample (which we argued overstates the true sample TE variance) \\(\\hat{V}_{neyman} =\\frac{s^2_c}{N_c}+\\frac{s^2_t}{N_t}\\) The Eicker-Huber-White variance estimator is not unbiased, and in settings where one of the treatment arms is rare, the difference may matter They give an example where it does not matter. DR: This point seems ignorable for most of our designs, as we intentionally avoid such rare arms (but in NL lottery maybe) 15.7.10 Regression Estimators with Additional Covariates [DR: seems important] For now they continue to focus on ‘pure randomisation’, not stratified nor merely exogenous conditional on observables Can include these additively: \\[Y^{obs}_i=\\alpha+\\tau W_i + \\beta&#39;\\dot{X}_i + \\epsilon_i\\] Can allow a ‘full set of interactions’ \\(Y^{obs}_i=\\alpha+\\tau W_i + \\beta&#39;\\dot{X}_i + \\gamma&#39;\\dot{X}_i W_i + \\epsilon_i\\) DR: They do not do much discussion here of whether to do additive or full interactions; maybe it comes later (causal trees etc) In general the least squares estimates based on these regression functions are not unbiased for the average treatment effects over the randomization distribution given the finite population. DR: Why not? Intuition? Which regression function of the ones above is referred to here? DR: The discussion below suggests it will still be consistent (asymptotically unbiased) There is one exception. If the covariates are all indicators and they partition the population, and we estimate the model with a full set of interactions, Equation (5.4), then the least squares estimate of \\(\\tau\\) is unbiased for the average treatment effect If \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the average value of \\(X_i\\) in the sample, then =_1{X}+_0(1−{X})$, and \\(\\hat{\\gamma}=\\hat{\\tau}_1-\\hat{\\tau}_0\\) With large sample approximations we can ‘say something about the case with multivalued covariates’ … “\\(\\tau\\) [DR: estimated how?] is asymptotically unbiased for the average treatment effect …” the asymptotic variance for \\(\\hat{\\tau}}\\) is less than that of the simple difference estimator by a factor equal to \\(1-R^2\\) from including the covariates relative to not including the covariates DR: This motivates the use of covariates even in a randomized design, and even if we don’t take the ‘model of the covariates’ seriously. “results do not rely on the regression model being true in the sense that the conditional expectation of Y obs i is actually linear in the covariates and the treatment indicator in the population” DR: Is this for the linear controls model or for the full interactions model? However, … If… the covariates have very skewed distributions, the finite sample bias in the linear regression estimates may be substantial DR: Intuition? The presence of non-zero values for γ imply treatment effect heterogeneity. Best argument for using only binary/categorical interactions: interpretation “Only if the covariates partition the population do these \\(\\gamma\\) have a clear interpretation as differences in average treatment effects.” DR: Could there not ever be a loss from including interactions and dividing up the sample too fine in doing this interactive estimation? This should depend on the true \\(R^2\\) I think. Try to remember what is the real tradeoff. ** 6 The Analysis of Stratified and paired randomized experiments ** 15.7.11 Stratified randomized experiments: analysis Case for stratification capture the gains from ex post regression adjustment without the potential costs of linear regression, and the potential costs of linear regression, and therefore stratification is generally preferable over regression adjustment Within this stratum we can estimate the average effect as the difference in average outcomes for treated and control units: \\(\\tauˆg = \\bar{Y}^{obs}_{t,g} − \\bar{Y}^{obs}_{c,g}\\), and we can estimate the within-stratum variance, using the Neyman results, as \\(\\hat{V}(\\hat{\\tau}) =\\frac{s^2_{t,g}}{N_{t,g}} + \\frac{s^2_{c,g}}{N_{c,g}}\\) where the g-subscript indexes the stratum [They wrote ‘j’ but I think its a typo] Next just average weighted by stratum shares: \\(\\hat{\\tau} = \\sum_{g=1..G}{\\hat{tau}_g \\frac{N_g}{N}\\) with estimated variance \\(\\sum_{g=1..G}\\)(_g)()^2$ DR: Presumably they mean the above mentioned Neyman variance Also note the squared term in the variance estimation, this may be how they computed the variance in the above empirical example “Special case”: proportion treat units the same in all strata \\(\\rightarrow\\) ATE estimator equals difference in means by treatment status: \\[\\hat{\\tau} = \\sum_{g=1..G}{\\hat{tau}_g \\frac{N_g}{N}}=\\bar{Y}^{obs}_t-\\bar{Y}^{obs}_c\\] … same as estimator for completely randomized experiment But the estimated variance for the latter will be overly conservative. DR: But I thought stratifying sometime ends up yielding a larger estimated variance? ##Paired randomized experiments: analysis (Skipping note-taking for now) 15.7.12 7 The Design of randomised experiments and the benefits of stratification … Our recommendation is that one should always stratify as much as possible, up to the point that each stratum contains at least two treated and two control units 15.7.13 7.1 Power calculations DR: This section is fairly basic and trivial, largely what we already know we largely focus on the formulation where the output is the minimum sample size required to find treatment effects of a pre-specified size with a pre-specified probability DR: My usual formulation DR: Why are they doing these calculations based on the t-statistic, when they recommend using other measures? DR: They claim equal sample sizes is “typically close to optimal” in cases without homoskedasticity. I think this is pure speculation. 15.7.14 Stratified randomized experiments: Benefits Stratifying does not remove any bias, it simply leads more precise inferences than complete randomization confusion in the literature concerning the benefits of stratification in small samples if this correlation is weak [between the stratifying variables and the outcome] in fact there is no tradeoff. We present formal results that show that in terms of expected-squared-error, stratification (with the same treatment probabilities in each stratum) cannot be worse than complete randomization. if one stratifies on a covariate that is independent of all other variables, then stratification is obviously equivalent to complete randomization. Ex ante, committing to stratification can only improve precision, not lower it Qualifications to this: Ex-post, given the joint distribution of the covariates in the sample, a particular stratification may be inferior to complete randomization. … Second, the result requires that the sample can be viewed as a (stratified) random sample from an infinitely large population… guarantees that outcomes within strata cannot be negatively correlated. (Note) The lack of any finite sample cost … contrasts with … regression adjustment. [which] may increase the finite sample variance, and in fact it will strictly increase the variance for any sample size, if the covariates have no predictive power at all. Although there is no cost to stratification in terms of the variance, there is a cost in terms of estimation of the variance. Still One can always use the variance that ignores the stratification: this is conservative if the stratification did in fact reduce the variance DR: Is it valid to simply say “we choose the lower value of the estimated variances”? Are they advocating this? Such a procedure seems like it would have a bias. exact variance for a completely randomized experiment can be written as … variance for the corresponding stratified randomized experiment is… the difference in the two variances is \\(V_C − V_S =... \\geq 0\\) DR: I am curious how these terms are derived and compared if the strata we draw from are small, say litters of puppies, it may well be that the within-stratum correlation is negative, but that is not possible if all the strata are large: in that case the correlation has to be non-negative DR: unless sutva violated perhaps (?) consider two estimators for the variance [both unbiased] \\(\\hat{V}_C=\\frac{s^2_{t,g}}{N_{t,g}} + \\frac{s^2_{c,g}}{N_{c,g}}\\) &gt; the natural estimator for the variance under the completely randomized experiment is: \\(\\hat{V}_c=\\frac{s^2_{t}}{N_{t}} + \\frac{s^2_{c,g}}{N_{c,g}}\\) or a stratified randomized experiment the natural variance estimator, taking into account the stratification, is: \\(\\hat{V}_S=\\frac{N_f}{N_f+N_m}\\Big(\\frac{s^2_{fc}}{N_{fc}}\\frac{s^2_{ft}}{N_{ft}}\\Big)+\\frac{N_f}{N_f+N_m}\\Big(\\frac{s^2_{mc}}{N_{mc}}\\frac{s^2_{mt}}{N_{mt}}\\Big)\\) Hence, \\(E\\hat{V}_S\\leq\\hat{V}_C\\). DR: Because we know both are unbiased and we know the true variance of \\(\\hat{V}_C\\) is larger. Nevertheless, the reverse may hold in a particular sample where the stratification is not related to the potential outcomes … the two variances are identical in expectation but the \\(var\\Big(hat{V}_S\\Big) &lt; var\\Big(hat{V}_C\\Big)\\) DR: This seems contradictory at first but I think it’s correct. The expectation of the estimated variance can be smaller or identical, while the variance of the estimated variance can still be larger. 15.7.15 Re-randomization Basically, they argue that if the first pre-implementation experiment comes out very unbalanced, you can randomize again – this will be an indirect method of stratifying. P-values could/should be adjusted to take into account that you are basically stratifying imprecisely. 15.7.16 Analysis of Clustered Randomised Experiments our main recommendation is to include analyses that are based on the cluster as the unit of analysis. Although more sophisticated analyses may be more informative than simple analyses using the clusters as units, it is rare that these differences in precision are substantial, and a cluster-based analysis has the virtue of great transparency DR: skipping most of this section for now 15.7.17 Noncompliance in randomized experiments (DR: Relevant to NL lottery, not to charity experiments) randomization that validates comparisons by treatment status does not validate comparisons by post-treatment variables such as the treatment received. DR: good quote for Nlmed Responses to noncompliance: ITT LATE Partial identification or bounds analysis Latter: “to obtain the range of values for the average causal effect of the receipt of treatment for the full population.” Another approach, not further discussed here, is the randomization-based approach to instrumental variables developed in Imbens and Rosenbaum (2005). [check into that] They recommend against: &gt; The first of these is an as-treated analysis, where units are compared by the treatment received; this relies on an unconfoundedness or selectionon-observables assumption. A second type of analysis is a per protocol analysis, where units are dropped who do not receive the treatment they were assigned to. We need some additional notation in this section. DR: Skipping full note-taking on this for now but COME BACK TO IT as it is very relevant to NL Med; the bounds analysis could be particularly interesting 15.7.18 Heterogenous Treatment Effects and Pretreatment Variables Crump et al setup (?) Multiple splits and tests may lead to overstated statistical significance for differences in TE’s. Bonferroni “overly conservative in an environment where many covariates are correlated with one another” List, Shaikh, and Xu (2016) propose an approach accounting for this; it uses bootstrapping, and requires pre-specifying list of tests to conduct ** 10.3 Estimating Treatment Effect Heterogeneity ** Parametric estimators, ‘all interactions’ (presumably with a correction as noted above) Nonparametric estimator of \\(\\tau(x)\\) The approach of List, Shaikh, and Xu (2016) works for an arbitrary set of null hypotheses, so the researcher could generate a long list of hypotheses using the causal tree approach restricted to different subsets of covariates, and then test them with a correction for multiple testing. Since in datasets with many covariates, there are often many ways to describe what are essentially the same sub-groups, we expect a lot of correlation in test statistics, reducing the magnitude of the correction for multiple hypothesis testing. 15.7.19 10.3.1 Data-driven Subgroup Analysis: Recursive Partitioning for Treatment Effects Partition sample by “region of covariate space” Determine which partition produces subgroups that differ the most in terms of treatment effects. The method avoids introducing biases in the estimated average treatment effects and allows for valid confidence intervals using “sample splitting,” or “honest” estimation Output of the method … is a set of subgroups, selected to optimize for treatment effect heterogeneity (to minimize expected mean-squared error of treatment effects), together with treatment effect estimates and standard errors for each subgroup. If instead… &gt; we estimate the average treatment effect on the two subsamples using the same sample, the fact that this particular split led to a high value of the criterion would often imply that the average treatment effect estimate is biased. But here ,,, &gt; The treatment effect estimates are unbiased on the two subsamples, and the corresponding confidence intervals are valid, even in settings with a large number of pretreatment variables or covariates. Because unit level TE is not observed, it is difficult to use standard protocols … suggest transforming outcome from Y_i^{obs} to \\(Y_i^\\ast=Y_i^{obs}\\frac{W_i−p}{p(1−p)}\\) … “so that standard methods for recursive partitioning based on prediction apply” Which implies \\(E[Y_i^\\ast|X_i=x]=\\tau(x)=E[Y_i(1)−Y_i(0)|X_i = x]\\) DR: Are these p’s conditional on the x’s? Probably it doesn’t matter here as they are assuming pure randomisation. AI criterion focuses directly on the expected squared error of the treatment effect estimator … which turns out to depend both on the t-statistic and on the fit measures. … further modified to anticipate … that the treatment effects will be re-estimated on an independent sample after the subgroups are selected This penalises too small groups and too much variance, (in general) rewards explain outcomes but not treatment effect heterogeneity…enables a lower-variance estimate of the treatment effect. Wager and W argue for inflating SE’s rather than partitioning - DR: I see an advantage there, as the AI approach throws away data 15.7.20 10.3.2 Non-Parametric Estimation of Treatment Effect Heterogeneity Many allow descriptive evidence and prediction, but few methods available that allow for confidence intervals K-nearest neighbors, hurdle methods Do not prioritise ‘more important’ covariates … can work well and provide satisfactory coverage of confidence intervals with one or two covariates, but performance deteriorates quickly after that. The output of the nonparametric estimator is a treatment effect for an arbitrary x. The estimates generally must be further summarized or visualized since the model produces a distinct prediction for each x. A key problem with kernels and nearest neighbor matching is that all covariates are treated symmetrically; if one unit is close to another in 20 dimensions, the units are probably not particularly similar in any given dimension. We would ideally like to prioritize dimensions that are most important for heterogeneous treatment effects, as is done in many machine learning methods, including the highly successful random forest algorithm. But these are often “bias-dominated asymptotically” … except the ones proposed by Wager and Athey (2015) :) asymptotically normal and centered on the true value of the treatment effect,… consistent estimator for the asymptotic variance. Averages over the many “trees” of the form developed in Athey and Imbens (2016) … different subsamples are used for each tree [plus some randomness] Each tree is “honest,” in that one subsample is used to determine a partition and [another] to estimate treatment effects within the leaves. Unlike the case of a single tree, no data is “wasted” because each observation is used to determine the partition in some trees and used to estimate treatment effects in other trees, and subsampling is already an inherent part of the method. What does this mean?: can obtain nominal coverage with more covariates than K-Nearest Neighbour matching or kernel methods, (but still “eventually becomes bias-dominated when the number of covariates grows” … but “much more robust to irrelevant covariates than kernels or nearest neighbor matching.”) Also, approaches fitting separately for treatment and control Also, Bayesian perspectives on this: Green and Kern (2011), Hill (2012), others … but unknown asymptotic properties (DR: do we care?) 15.7.21 10.3.3 Treatment Effect Heterogeneity Using Regularized Regression Lasso-like (Imai and Ratkovic (2013), etc.) With few important covariates (a ‘sparse’ model), can derive valid CI’s w/o sample-splitting Some proposed modeling heterogeneity separately for treatment and control;… can be inefficient if the covariates that affect the level of outcomes are distinct from those that affect treatment effect heterogeneity. alternative … incorporate interactions … as covariates, and then allow LASSO to select which covariates are important. 15.7.22 10.3.4 Comparison of Methods Lasso: more sparsity restrictions, better handle linear or polynomial relationships between covariates and outcomes; outputs a regression; but CI’s justified only under strict conditions Random forest methods … are more localized, … capture complex, multi-dimensional interactions among covariates, or highly nonlinear interactions. Less sensitive to sparsity, CI’s do not ‘deteriorate’ as covariates grow (but MSE of predictions suffer) Inference more justifiable by random assignment (Lasso requires stronger assumptions) List of references "],["metaanalysis.html", "16 Meta-analysis and combining studies: Making inferences from previous work 16.1 Notes: Christensen et al 2019, ch 5, ’Using all evidence, registration and meta-analysis 16.2 Excerpts and notes from ‘Doing Meta-Analysis in R: A Hands-on Guide’ (Harrer et al) 16.3 Dealing with publication bias 16.4 Other notes, links, and commentary 16.5 Other resources and tools 16.6 Example: discussion of meta-analyses of the Paleolithic diet BELOW", " 16 Meta-analysis and combining studies: Making inferences from previous work My opinion on why this is so important (unfold): It is lame how often I see ‘new experiments’ and ‘new studies’ that tread most of the ground as old studies, spend lots of money, get a publication and … ignore or pay lip service to the previous findings. There is tons of data out there that can inform new questions and bring better through re-analysis and combination with other data. Otherwise we are not actually building progress. This is why I became involved with a project I called ‘ExpArchive’, later working with projects such as GESIS’ X-Econ to try to encourage and facilitate data sharing in experimental economics, as well as the innovationsinfundraising.org project, which is now collaborating with the Lily Institute’s “revolutionizing philanthropy research” (RPR) project. 16.1 Notes: Christensen et al 2019, ch 5, ’Using all evidence, registration and meta-analysis how the research community can systematically collect, organize, and analyze a body of research work Limitations to the ‘narrative literature review’: subjectivity, too much info to narrate 16.1.1 The origins [and importance] of study [pre-]registration … Make details of planned and ongoing studies available to the community …. including those not (yet) published Required by FDA in 1997, many players in medical community followed soon after Turner ea (08) and others documented massive publication bias and misrepresentation … but registration far from fully enforced (Mathieu ea ’09) found 46% clealy registered, and discrepancies between registered and published outcomes ! 16.1.2 Social science study registries Jameel 2009 AEA 2013, 2100 registrations to date RIDIE, EGAP, AsPredicted OSF allowing a DOI (25,000+) 16.1.3 Meta-analysis Key references: Borenstein ea ’09, Cooper, Hedges, and V ’09 16.1.3.1 Selecting studies \"some scholarly discretion regarding which measures are ‘close enough’ to be included… contemperanous meta-analyses on the same topic finding opposit e conclusions ‘asses the robustness… to different inclusion conditions’… see Doucouliagos ea ’17 on inclusion options My opinion: this is the key barrier to meta-analysis in social science! How do we weight studies using different methodologies and in different contexts? The Bayesian Random Effects approach seems to offer some help here (this not to be confused with the random effects panel-data models discussed in standard Econometrics texts). 16.1.3.2 Assembling estimates Which statistic to collect? Studies \\(j \\in J, j= 1..N_j\\) Relevant estimate of stat from each study is \\(\\hat{ \\beta_j}\\) with SE \\(\\hat{\\sigma_j}\\) Papers report several estimates (e.g., in robustness checks): which to choose, esp if author’s preferred approach differs from other scholars. Ex from Hsiang, B, Miguel, ’13: links between extreme climate and violence how to classify outcomes… interpersonal and intergroup… normalised as pct changes wrt the meanoutcome in that dataset how to standardice climate varn measures… chose SD from local area mean (DR: this choice implicitly reflects a behavioural assumption) \\(\\rightarrow\\) ‘pct change in a conflict outcome as a fncn of a 1 SD schock to local climate’ 16.1.4 Combining estimates ‘Fixed-effect meta-analysis approach’: assumes a single true effect’ DR: I’m not sure I agree on this assesment of why this is unlikely to be true in practice… ‘differences in measures’ (etc) seem to be a different issue Equal weight approach: (Simply the average across studies… ugh) Precision-weighted approach: \\[\\hat{\\beta}_{PW}= \\sum_{j}p_j\\hat{\\beta}_j/ \\sum_{j}p_j\\] where \\(p_j\\) is the estimated precision for study \\(j\\): \\(\\frac{1}{\\hat{\\sigma_i}^2}\\) Thus the weight \\(\\omega_j\\) placed on study \\(j\\) is proportional to it’s precision. ‘implies weight in proportion to sample size’? I think that’s loosely worded, it must be nonlinear. \\(\\rightarrow\\) This minimises the variance in the resulting meta-analytical estimate: \\[var(\\hat{\\beta}_{PW}) =\\sum_j \\omega_j\\hat{\\sigma_j}^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sum_j(p_j)}\\] ‘inclusion of additional estimates always reduces the SE of \\(\\hat{\\beta_{PW}}\\) [in expectation].’ … so more estimtes can’t hurt as long as you know their precision.

Is this the estimated variance or the variance of the estimate? and how do we estimate some of the components of these, like \\(\\hat{\\tau}\\)? Intuitively, if estimated [TE] in all studies are near one another and have relatively wide and overlapping [CI’s], then most of the difference in estimates is likely the result of sampling variation [and \\(\\tau\\)] is likely to be close to zero. DR: But if the TE have wide CI’s, do we have power to idfy btwn-study hety? … I guess that’s what the ‘estimated TE are all near each other’ gives us? … Alternatively, if there is extensive variation in the estimated ATEs but each is precise… \\(\\tau\\) is likely to be relatively large. Coding meta-analyses in R “A Review of Meta-Analysis Packages in R” offers a helpful guide to the various packages, such as metafor. Doing Meta-Analysis in R: A Hands-on Guide appears extremely helpful; see, e.g., their chapter Bayesian Meta-Analysis in R using the brms package The \\(I^2\\) stat is a measure of the proportion of total variation attributed to cross-study variation; if \\(\\hat{\\sigma}_j\\) is the same across all studies we have: \\(I^2(.) = \\hat{\\tau}^2/(\\hat{\\tau}^2 + \\hat{\\sigma}^2)\\) 16.2 Excerpts and notes from ‘Doing Meta-Analysis in R: A Hands-on Guide’ (Harrer et al) Some notes follow excerpting and commenting on Doing Meta-Analysis in R: A Hands-on Guide Note that installation of the required packages can be tricky here.

You can do a similar calculation with raw data (rather than aggregated data) using the meta::metacont command, as he shows. I think it just does all the aggregation within the function but it’s otherwise the same. Harrer’s notes on whether we should use RE or FE (unfold) “The random-effects-model pays more attention to small studies when pooling the overall effect in a meta-analysis (Schwarzer, Carpenter, and Rücker 2015). Yet, small studies in particular are often fraught with bias (see Chapter 8.1). This is why some have argued that the fixed-effects-model should be nearly always preferred (Poole and Greenland 1999; Furukawa, McGuire, and Barbui 2003).” DR: somewhow I’m not sure the “pays more attention to small studies” point is correct, although it is certainly empirically the case below Random effects model There are a variety of estimators for the variance of the true effect size \\(\\tau^2\\). You must choose one. He recommends Veroniki et al’s discussion of this. DerSimonian-Laird (1986) estimator is the most common \"Maximum-Likelihood, Sidik-Jonkman, and Empirical Bayes estimators have better properties in estimating the between-study variance (Sidik and Jonkman 2007; Viechtbauer 2005). DerSimonian-Laird is also seen to be prone to producing false positives (for the mean effect I think?)

In the brms package we will be using in this chapter, the No-U-Turn Sampler, or NUTS (Hoffman and Gelman 2014), is used. MCMC is used to sample from the posterior distribution. Without MCMC, to sample from the posterior the normalising constant would have to be found. But with most prior/likelihood combinations, the integral to find it is intractable. Why use Bayesian? to “directly model the uncertainty when estimating [the between-study variance] \\(\\tau^2\\)” “have been found to be superior in estimating the between-study heterogeneity and pooled effect, particularly when the number of included studies is small” “produce full posterior distributions for both \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\tau\\)” … so we can make legitimate statements about the probabilities of true parameters “allow us to integrate prior knowledge and assumptions when calculating meta-analyses” (including methodological uncertainty perhaps) Setting weakly informative’ priors for the mean and cross-study variance of the TE sizes It has been argued that a good approach is to use weakly informative priors (Williams, Rast, and Bürkner 2018) [rather than ‘non-informative priors’!]. With a non-informative prior, we are essentially saying that we do not have any prior information on the effect size, whereas often we do have some information, and would like to include it in our analyis. Make sure to research priors before using them, as some be be very informative, with an example being the uniform distibution saying that extreme values are as likely as moderate values. For \\(\\mu\\): include distributions which represent that we do indeed have some confidence that some values are more credible than others, while still not making any overly specific statements about the exact true value of the parameter. … In most applied cases, it seems reasonable to assume that the true effect size we want to estimate must lie somewhere between, for example, Cohen’s \\(d=-2.0\\) and \\(d=2.0\\), but will unlikely be hovering around \\(d=50\\). A good starting point for our \\(\\mu\\) prior may therefore be a normal distribution with mean \\(0\\) and variance \\(1\\). This means that we grant a 95% prior probability that the true pooled effect size \\(\\mu\\) lies between \\(d=-2.0\\) and \\(d=2.0\\). \\[ \\mu \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\] Discussion (unfold) SD: There has to be very good reason for setting the prior mean to be different from zero, as that would mean holding a prior belief of a (potentially) strong, positive or negative effect. Normally it is better to use a prior with a neutral effect. With regards to the variance of \\(\\mu\\), consider the order of magnitude of the response, and how much each effect will have. A variance of one is large enough to explore the parameter space, without being too large to allow for extreme values. … [A prior distinct from 0] only if we genuinely believe there to be a positive effect, otherwise we are not being “consistent” (a Bayesian term which links to our probability for an event to being our best guess estimate). Because if we are unsure if there is a positive or negative effect, then we would be ‘incoherent’ by having a positive prior effect - it would be better for our best guess estimate to have a neutral effect. A further discussion on ‘coherence’ in the Bayesian framework versus ‘bias’ in the frequentist world (unfold). SD: I think a big part of the discussion here comes from the subjective-objective debate in probability theory, and the way that statistics is studied. Classical statistics postulates that a variable theta is a true, objective, physical value, and that data y is randomly drawn from a distribution with those parameters. Expectation is defined from probability. Bayesians on the other hand start with the data; y is not random, it is known to us. The parameters theta are random, in that they are unknown to us (and subjectively unknown to each of us). Probability is defined from expectation, and our probability for an event is our subjective best guess estimate for that event. We are not being coherent if our probability is not our best guess estimate, that is, if we can make a better estimate for sure. If we’re not not coherent, we’re not being consistent with our beliefs. So because of this, the concept of bias doesn’t really exist for subjectivists; there is no long run frequentist true parameter that our best guess is being distant from. Coherence is absolutely key to the concept, as it is about my belief and my best guess. That’s where the subjectivity comes into the analysis, because you may believe one prior (for instance one with a mean of 1), whereas I may believe another prior (with a mean of 0). There isn’t any correct answer, and as long as we are being coherent, because we’re sampling from our posteriors for this parameter given our own beliefs and our own subjective uncertainty. Often on Bayesian projects there is a prior elicitation, where people come together and discuss what their subjective priors are and how they will proceed. I think there is some merit in this line of thought though, because clearly if you have a prior with a mean of, say, 1,000,000 then you’re really influencing your effect. But then arguably if you do so, you’re not being coherent. It’s quite a deep, long, philosophical discussion for a meta analysis, but it is crucial to the frequentist vs Bayesian debate. More here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_of_an_estimator#Bayesian_view For \\(\\tau^2\\) must be non-negative, but might be very close to zero. Recommended distribution for this case (for variances in general): Half-Cauchy prior (a censored Cauchy) \\(\\mathcal{HC}(x_0,s)\\) with location parameter \\(x_0\\) (peak on x-axis) and \\(s\\), scaling parameter ‘how heavy-tailed’ Half-Cauchy distribution for varying \\(s\\), with \\(x_0=0\\): HC is ’heavy-tailed;… gives some probability to very high values but low values are still more likely. One might consider \\(s=0.3\\) Note that the Half-Cauchy distribution has an undefined mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis. It does have a mode, at \\(x_0\\). One might consider \\(s=0.3\\) DR: \\(s\\) corresponds to the std deviation here? … so an SD of the effect size about 1/3 of it’s mean size? SD: Since the Cauchy distribution has infinite mean (hence undefined first moment) and variance, it doesn’t make sense to discuss \\(s\\) in this way. \\(s\\) is a way of capturing the dispersion of the distribution. Checking the share of this distribution below 0.3… phcauchy(0.3, sigma = 0.3) #cumulative share of distribution below 0.3 ... is 1/2 ... with sigma=0.3 ## [1] 0.5 … But they go for the ‘more conservative’ \\(s=0.5\\). In general, it is advised to always conduct sensitivity analyses with different prior specifications to check if they affect the results substantially. With enough data, the effect of the prior should shrink. Some priors never allow the data to overload them, so we should be careful using them. DR: Todo - insert a formal definition “Smaller and smaller” could be measured in terms of some metrics over the shift in the distribution, I presume. Perhaps there are several ways of measuring this (average shifts, weighted average, maximum shift for any segment, etc). Complete model: \\[ \\hat\\theta_k \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\theta_k,\\sigma_k^2) \\] \\[ \\theta_k \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\tau^2) \\] \\[ \\mu \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\] \\[ \\tau \\sim \\mathcal{HC}(0,0.5)\\] Bayesian Meta-Analysis in R using the brms package You specify the priors as a vector of elements, each of which invokes the ‘prior’ function, which makes some sort of data frame. The priors function takes a distribution function with parameters, and a ‘class’. priors &lt;- c(prior(normal(0,1), class = Intercept), prior(cauchy(0,0.5), class = sd)) A quick look at the data we’re using here: str(madata[,1:3]) ## tibble [18 × 3] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ## $ Author: chr [1:18] &quot;Call et al.&quot; &quot;Cavanagh et al.&quot; &quot;DanitzOrsillo&quot; &quot;de Vibe et al.&quot; ... ## $ TE : num [1:18] 0.709 0.355 1.791 0.182 0.422 ... ## $ seTE : num [1:18] 0.261 0.196 0.346 0.118 0.145 ... TE: calculated effect size of each study, expressed as the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) seTE: the standard error corresponding to each effect size Author: a unique identifier for each study/effect size. To actually run the model, he uses the following code: This requires careful installation of packages. See here for Mac OS Catalina, R 4.9 instructions. DR: I find it surprising how long this procedure takes to run this simulation, given that the actual data used (estimates and SE’s) is rather small. It seems to be that the C++ model takes long to compile; we sort this out below. 2000 iterations seems to be a ‘norm’. [source?] The issue here seems to be that it takes a long time to compile the C++ model each time; it might be something we can write to avoid this step. SD: It will take some time to compile the model, and this is inevitable (it takes a long time with every model, this one works pretty quickly at a few minutes), but once it has compiled, it should not take a long time to sample. Below is some code to change the number of samples and show the speed once the model has compiled.

The number of iterations can be any ‘’high number’’. A commonly used amount is 2000 iterations and four chains. The reason the number should be high is that the MCMC sampler needs to converge in distribution to the target distribution. SD: “High” may depend on several factors (such as what distribution we’re trying to sample from, the amount of time it takes to sample, how accurate we want it to be, etc.). But broadly we want to make sure we have more samples than fewer as we want to be confident that we have converged to the target distribution. I’d usually stick to something in the thousands to be sure. There is a good discussion about it on the answers here: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/203281/number-of-markov-chain-monte-carlo-samples The formula for the model is specified using ‘regression formula notation’ (unfold)… As there is no ‘predictor variable’ in such analyses (unless it’s meta-regression), x is replaced with 1. But we want to give studies that more precisely estimate the effect size (perhaps because they have a larger sample) a greater weight. Coded using the y|se(se_y) element For the random effects terms he adds (1|study) to the predictor part (or here (1|author). prior: Plugs in the priors created above plug in the priors object we created previously here. iter: Number of iterations of MCMC algorithm… the more complex your model, the higher this number should be. [DR: but what’s a rule of thumb here – see links in margein note?] Assesing convergence (has MCMC algo found an optimum?) If it hasn’t converged, don’t trust it! You may need to boost the number of iterations “Posterior predictive checks”: If it’s converged, then the density of the replications should resemble the original data. DRL Not sure I understand this; may need to revise and give a clear explanation. I guess it’s something like ‘the estimated parameter densities can then be drawn and run to simulate a dgp, which should yield data looking like the original data set’… pp_check(m.brm) ## Using 10 posterior samples for ppc type &#39;dens_overlay&#39; by default. A commonly used method of assessing convergence is to look at the traceplots. There should be no distinctive patterns, and they should not have large spikes. Good traceplots look “well mixed”, suggesting that the parameter space is being explored.* Is ‘assessing convergence’ a subjective judgement? (Unfold a discussion.) SD: We will never know if the sampler has converged to the target distribution, but with more and more samples and well mixed traceplots, along with R-hats close to 1, we can be very confident that it has. I think that it is the same for other subjective methods such as GAMs, where the number of splines to include is very subjective. There are some tests used to help inform the statistician about the suitability of more/less splines, but ultimately it is down to the statistician to make the judgement about it. DR: Rather than ‘subjective’ I would suspect that: 1. There are numerical measures for assessing this convergence (as there are in optimisation problems) 2. Perhaps there remains debate over which is the best method. SD: I think that the R hat is one of those numerical methods, I’m not completely sure about that though. There is a paper discussing them and it comes up on Arxiv. I think effective sample size is another one of those numerical measures. There is some discussion on which methods are best here: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/507/what-is-the-best-method-for-checking-convergence-in-mcmc It seems that most people use a combination of both numerical methods and visual checking. When I studied it, we checked the Rhat, the effective sample size, and checked for patterns in the trace plots (eg obvious autocorrelation, large spikes, etc) There are some good slides on visually assessing convergence here: https://astrostatistics.psu.edu/RLectures/diagnosticsMCMC.pdf library(bayesplot) ## This is bayesplot version 1.7.2 ## - Online documentation and vignettes at mc-stan.org/bayesplot ## - bayesplot theme set to bayesplot::theme_default() ## * Does _not_ affect other ggplot2 plots ## * See ?bayesplot_theme_set for details on theme setting mcmc_trace(m.brm) Also check for a Potential Scale Reduction Factor (PSRF), or \\(\\hat{R}\\) below 1.01. SD: Rhat is a Bayesian measure used to determine convergence - I don’t think that Harrer will go into detail. It has a complicated formula, but all we should focus on is that Rhat converges to 1 as n tends to infinity.

Interpreting the Results Above we see the estimated ‘sd of the mean effect’ and the ‘mean effect’, and ‘est. error’ and CI’s for each. Is ‘est error’ this like a measure of the standard deviation of the estimated coefficient? Here CI’s are ‘credible intervals’. We can also extract the estimated deviation of each study’s “true” effect size from the pooled effect: ranef(m.brm) ## $Author ## , , Intercept ## ## Estimate Est.Error Q2.5 Q97.5 ## Call et al. 0.074 0.20 -0.329 0.488 ## Cavanagh et al. -0.141 0.18 -0.507 0.192 ## DanitzOrsillo 0.483 0.29 -0.011 1.095 ## de Vibe et al. -0.316 0.14 -0.626 -0.044 ## Frazier et al. -0.115 0.15 -0.420 0.165 ## Frogeli et al. 0.039 0.17 -0.310 0.378 ## Gallego et al. 0.088 0.18 -0.266 0.448 ## Hazlett-Stevens &amp; Oren -0.027 0.18 -0.385 0.322 ## Hintz et al. -0.203 0.17 -0.553 0.099 ## Kang et al. 0.282 0.24 -0.149 0.806 ## Kuhlmann et al. -0.307 0.19 -0.706 0.034 ## Lever Taylor et al. -0.106 0.19 -0.498 0.248 ## Phang et al. -0.020 0.19 -0.423 0.353 ## Rasanen et al. -0.080 0.20 -0.497 0.316 ## Ratanasiripong -0.020 0.22 -0.482 0.413 ## Shapiro et al. 0.399 0.25 -0.034 0.959 ## SongLindquist 0.026 0.18 -0.339 0.381 ## Warnecke et al. 0.014 0.20 -0.389 0.405 These are measures of deviations. But they don’t exactly equal the difference between the input effect size and the estimated pooled effect size. In fact this is coming from an estimate of the true effect for each study which ‘averages towards the mean’ following some criteria (this is mentioned later). No p-values listed because this is Bayesian. SD: With a classical analysis, we would ask if there is enough evidence of an effect to reject the null hypothesis of no impact at a (subjective) significance level. With a Bayesian approach, the entire distribution of the parameter is calcuated, is it is better to observe the distribution of the parameter. Frequentist analyses give binary answers to continuous questions, whereas with Bayesian analyses, continuous questions have continuous answers. (Paraphrasing Daniel XXX). Instead he states: the Estimate of the pooled effect size is SMD = 0.57, with the 95% credibility interval (not confidence interval!) ranging from 95% CrI: 0.40 − 0.77. This indicates that there is in fact a moderate-sized overall effect of the interventions studied in this meta-analysis.

Mean versus mode, I guess. Maybe we want to know (e.g.) “the probability that the pooled effect is \\(SMD=0.30\\) or smaller, based on our model.” Because maybe an effect of 0.30 or smaller means it’s not worth using this drug or something Consider the Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF) “of the posterior distribution for the pooled effect size”… Use the ecdf function to implement the ECDF… then check… smd.ecdf &lt;- ecdf(post.samples$smd) smd.ecdf(0.3) ## [1] 0.0015 We see that the probability of our pooled effect being smaller than \\(SMD = 0.30\\) is very, very low, so the effects of the interventions we find in this meta-analysis are very likely to be meaningful. Plotting the ECDF below: 16.2.3 Forest plots Forest plots are great, esp. with Bayesian, where we’ve ‘sampled posterior distributions’… but there’s no prepackaged tool yet. So we’ve to build it with help from the tidybayes package. First we prepare the data, extracting the posterior distribution for each study individually. Use the spread_draws function … takes, as input 1. the fitted brms model, 2. the random-effects index factor and the parameter to extract (here b_Intercept). …calculate actual effect sizes for each by adding the pooled effect size b_Intercept to the estimated deviation for each study. study.draws &lt;- spread_draws(m.brm, r_Author[Author,], b_Intercept) %&gt;% mutate(b_Intercept = r_Author + b_Intercept) Next, generate the distribution of the pooled effect (usually out in the last row of forest plots). pooled.effect.draws &lt;- spread_draws(m.brm, b_Intercept) %&gt;% mutate(Author = &quot;Pooled Effect&quot;) Bind this together, clean labels and reorder: forest.data &lt;- bind_rows(study.draws, pooled.effect.draws) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% mutate(Author = str_replace_all(Author, &quot;[.]&quot;, &quot; &quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(Author = reorder(Author, b_Intercept)) Generate summarized data (the mean and credibility interval) of each study. Group the above by author, use the mean_qi function (generates 95pct intervals) to calculate these. forest.data.summary &lt;- group_by(forest.data, Author) %&gt;% mean_qi(b_Intercept) Now generate the forest plot: ggplot(aes(b_Intercept, relevel(Author, &quot;Pooled Effect&quot;, after = Inf)), data = forest.data) + geom_vline(xintercept = fixef(m.brm)[1, 1], color = &quot;grey&quot;, size = 1) + geom_vline(xintercept = fixef(m.brm)[1, 3:4], color = &quot;grey&quot;, linetype = 2) + geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = &quot;black&quot;, size = 1) + geom_density_ridges(fill = &quot;blue&quot;, rel_min_height = 0.01, col = NA, scale = 1, alpha = 0.8) + geom_pointintervalh(data = forest.data.summary, size = 1) + geom_text(data = mutate_if(forest.data.summary, is.numeric, round, 2), aes(label = glue(&quot;{b_Intercept} [{.lower}, {.upper}]&quot;), x = Inf), hjust = &quot;inward&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Standardized Mean Difference&quot;, y = element_blank()) + theme_minimal() Remember, these are not the effect sizes from the original studies. There has been some bayesian updating of each of these, considering all the others. 16.3 Dealing with publication bias Exacerbated by multiple-hypothesis-testing?

I’ve also forked Kurtz’s repo here, which I may play with. 17.2.1 The Golem of Prague (Chapter 1) Don’t let your model or approach turn into a Golem you can’t control. Don’t ‘believe the model’; continuously validate it. The map is not the territory. ‘Statistical decision trees’ lend a false sense of security… and almost never fit the actual case we are dealing with. (fig 1.1) Statistical models are non-unique maps to ‘process models’ which are non-unique maps to hypotheses. (He offers the example of neutral evolutionary selection’ example.) This makes strict falsification impossible: How can you falsify a hypothesis/theory if it corresponds to a wide set of process models and statistical models, many of which overlap other hypotheses? But this warning is at least as relevant for Bayesian analyses, which must be based on specifically defined (term) models of the DGP etc. Thus he recommends caution and continuous (?) interplay between the model and the data. (See next chapter … ‘small worlds and large worlds’.) He also suggests we refer not to ‘Confidence intervals’ or even ‘Credible intervals’, but to ‘Consistent intervals’ … as in ‘these intervals are consistent with the model and data’. And… [so you should] ‘…Explicitly compare predictions of more than one model’ Rethinking: Is NHST falsificationist? (#fig:failure_of_falsification.png)From McElreath video lecture 1 Null hypothesis significance testing, NHST, is often identified with the falsificationist, or Popperian, philosophy of science. However, usually NHST is used to falsify a null hypothesis, not the actual research hypothesis. So the falsification is being done to something other than the explanatory model. This seems the reverse from Karl Popper’s philosophy. I.e., scientists have turned things upside down; originally the idea was that you had substitute of hypotheses that you would want to falsify and now we try to falsify silly null hypotheses that “nothing is going on”. You should try to really build a hypothesis and test it not just reject that nothing is going on. 17.2.1.1 Book’s foci Bayesian data analysis Multilevel modeling Model comparison using information criteria 17.2.2 Small Worlds and Large Worlds (Ch 2) … The way that Bayesian models learn from evidence is arguably optimal in the small world. When their assumptions approximate reality, they also perform well in the large world. But large world performance has to be demonstrated rather than logically deduced. (p. 20) We imagine a bag filled with four marbles, each of which is blue or white. “So, if we’re willing to code the marbles as 0 =”white\" 1 = “blue”, we can arrange the possibility data in a tibble as follows.\" I.e., we can consider the five possible worlds, in each of which the bag has a different number of white and blue marbles, and represent each of these worlds as a column vector: d &lt;- tibble(p_1 = 0, p_2 = rep(1:0, times = c(1, 3)), p_3 = rep(1:0, times = c(2, 2)), p_4 = rep(1:0, times = c(3, 1)), p_5 = 1) d Table 17.1: p_1p_2p_3p_4p_5 01111 00111 00011 00001 We visualize this in the plot below, where each column is one ‘world’: d %&gt;% gather() %&gt;% #make it long, with an ket variable for the possibility &#39;world&#39; mutate(x = rep(1:4, times = 5), #an index for &#39;which ball&#39; possibility = rep(1:5, each = 4)) %&gt;% #distributing the &#39;which world&#39; index ggplot(aes(x = x, y = possibility, fill = value %&gt;% as.character())) + geom_point(shape = 21, size = 5) + scale_fill_manual(values = c(&quot;white&quot;, &quot;navy&quot;)) + scale_x_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(.75, 4.25), ylim = c(.75, 5.25)) + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) Simple combinatorics (permutations rule) tells us how many ‘ways’ we can draw 1, 2, and 3 marbles… Here we think about ‘which’ marble is drawn, and not just ‘which color’ it is. We can draw marble 1-4, the first time, then 1-4 the second time, and then 1-4 the third time… so possibilities=marbles ^ draw. tibble(draw = 1:3, marbles = 4) %&gt;% mutate(possibilities = marbles ^ draw) %&gt;% knitr::kable() draw marbles possibilities 1 4 4 2 4 16 3 4 64 Next, there is a huge amount of code explaining how to make the ‘garden of forking paths’ diagrams. I’m basically going to skip all that code, and paste in a few images. You can find all the code HERE Suppose there is only one blue ball and three white balls, possibility ‘2’ above. For this world, we see the full ‘garden of forking paths’ — the number of ways to select 1, 2, and 3 balls (with replacement) — below. Every path starting from the center is a possible (sequence of) draws. Figure 17.1: All possible draws of three balls Now the inferential exercise: we want to know (the likelihood) of each of the five possible ‘worlds’. As we draw data we know we are proceeding along one of some subset of the forking paths. For example, under possible world 2, if we draw Blue, then White, then Blue, this could have occured with any of the following paths (consider a draw of each of the white balls as distinct): Figure 17.2: All possible draws of three balls We see that under World 2 there are 3 ways of getting this sequence. 3 out of \\(4^3\\) equally likely paths under World 2, or a \\(3/64\\) chance (about 5%). We can do similar for the other possible worlds; multiplying the ‘ways to produce each draw’ in the path yields the ‘total ways to produce the path’, under each world. # if we make two custom functions, here, it will simplify the code within `mutate()`, below n_blue &lt;- function(x) { rowSums(x == &quot;b&quot;) } n_white &lt;- function(x) { rowSums(x == &quot;w&quot;) } t &lt;- # for the first four columns, `p_` indexes position tibble(p_1 = rep(c(&quot;w&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), times = c(1, 4)), p_2 = rep(c(&quot;w&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), times = c(2, 3)), p_3 = rep(c(&quot;w&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), times = c(3, 2)), p_4 = rep(c(&quot;w&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), times = c(4, 1))) %&gt;% mutate(`draw 1: blue` = n_blue(.), `draw 2: white` = n_white(.), `draw 3: blue` = n_blue(.)) %&gt;% mutate(`ways to produce` = `draw 1: blue` * `draw 2: white` * `draw 3: blue`) t %&gt;% knitr::kable() p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4 draw 1: blue draw 2: white draw 3: blue ways to produce w w w w 0 4 0 0 b w w w 1 3 1 3 b b w w 2 2 2 8 b b b w 3 1 3 9 b b b b 4 0 4 0 Among of all possible worlds, we see the most number of ways to get B-W-B in a world 4; with three blues and one white – here there are 9 ways in total to get B-W-B. Under world 4 this sequence occurs 9/64, or roughly 14% of the time. We can see this in the following plot. (We leave out the worlds with only one color ball, as these will have no paths that produce B-W-B). Below, each partitioned section represents one world, and the paths in that world that could produce B-W-B are shown. Figure 17.3: All possible draws of three balls Three paths, versus 8 paths, versus nine paths… Does this reveal world 4 to be the most likely contents of the present bag? Not necessarily. Suppose we knew ex-ante, from the factory, that ‘99 bags out of 100 have equal numbers of whites and blues.’ Then, it would be much more likely that this bag was from an equal-color bag (world 3), even though this draw is more likely conditional on the bag being from world 4. We need will to consider the base-rate probabilities as well. This in turn motivates the standard ‘false positive/false negative HIV test’ example. 17.2.3 Using prior information We may have prior information about the relative plausibility of each conjecture. This prior information could arise from knowledge of how the contents of the bag were generated. It could also arise from previous data. Or we might want to act as if we had prior information, so we can build conservatism into the analysis. Whatever the source, it would help to have a way to use prior information. Luckily there is a natural solution: Just multiply the prior count by the new count. (p. 25) This seems to easy to be true, but our garden illustration helps us understand why it is the case. 17.2.3.1 “Multiply in” new information First consider, what if we had another draw from the bag, how would this adjust the ‘number of paths’ for each world? Remember, each draw is independent (replacement). We simply record the number of ways (permutations) that could lead to this draw in each world, and we multiply the previous count by this number. You can consider this visually in seeing how ‘adding an additional fork at the end of each path’ changes the count. This is given in the table below: t &lt;- t %&gt;% rename(`previous counts` = `ways to produce`, `ways to produce` = `draw 1: blue`) %&gt;% select(p_1:p_4, `ways to produce`, `previous counts`) %&gt;% mutate(`new count` = `ways to produce` * `previous counts`) t %&gt;% knitr::kable() p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4 ways to produce previous counts new count w w w w 0 0 0 b w w w 1 3 3 b b w w 2 8 16 b b b w 3 9 27 b b b b 4 0 0 How to incorporate prior information about the probability of each world? Suppose your friend in the factory tells you (reliably) that “we produce 3 bags with (just) 1 blue for every 2 bags with equal counts, for every 1 bag with 3 blues.” We can think of the ‘factory choosing which bag to produce’ as another draw, thus another path. Here the sequence in which the information is recieved shouldn’t matter. The draws are independent (we presume). We can thus multiply the number of paths for each marbles-in-bag world by the (relative) frequency with which the factory ‘draws’ that bag… as shown below: t &lt;- t %&gt;% select(p_1:p_4, `new count`) %&gt;% rename(`prior count` = `new count`) %&gt;% mutate(`factory count` = c(0, 3:0)) %&gt;% mutate(`new count` = `prior count` * `factory count`) t %&gt;% knitr::kable() p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4 prior count factory count new count w w w w 0 0 0 b w w w 3 3 9 b b w w 16 2 32 b b b w 27 1 27 b b b b 0 0 0 17.2.4 From counts to probability. 17.3 Third video/chapter Regression is a useful simplification, similar to the Ptolomeic geocentric model 17.3.1 Normal distributions Normal distributions are hugely common in nature because it is ‘the product of adding small fluctutations’; there are the most combinations that produce ‘no movement from the center’ But this means that seeing a normal distribution tells you little about the underlying process Addition, ‘the mathematical function where order doesn’t matter’ (not even adding 0’s), leads to Normal distributions 17.4 Title: “Introduction to Bayesian analysis in R and Stata - Katz, Qstep” Content from notes from this lecture 17.4.1 Why and when use Bayesian (MCMC) methods? 17.4.1.1 Pros No need for asymptotics … good when sample sizes are small Incorporate previous information You can consider the ‘robustness to other priors’ Fit complex nonstandard models … e.g., with difficult functional forms or likelihood settings (more computation, less thinking) Easy to make predictions (e.g., simulate scenarios) after estimation Incorporate evidence, results, expert judgement (‘restrictions’ with some lee-way?) (ISn’t this the same as number 2?) Cleaner treatment/imputation of missing values … these are just parameters 17.4.1.2 Cons Must specify prior distributions … allows subjective judgement Different way of thinking about stats and inference; probability distributions and simulations, not much about p-values, point estimates and standard errors … path dependence Computational cost This is an R Markdown document.

Starting from around 2005 in Political Science and Sociology Computational revolution comes from Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods … don’t need analytical solutions Software implementations – many in R, specialised software like EWinBugs, JAGS, STAN; also increasingly in Stata 17.4.2 Theory Bayes theorem … inverting conditional probability thing … ‘inversion’ to make inferences about the parameters In Bayesian stats the parameters (and sometimes missing values) are random variables, we make probability statements about them \\[P(A|B)=P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)\\] Frequentist: Point estimates, unknown fixed parameters, data from a hyol repeataable random sample Bayesian: Fixed data (from the experiment), parameters are random variables … results based on probability distributions about rthese Classical statistics: likelihood of data given parameter: \\(p(y|\\theta)\\) Bayes we want, \\(p(\\theta|y) = p(y|\\theta)p(\\theta)/p(y)\\) \\(p(y)\\) is a ‘constant’ in our estimation … the data is fixed. So it’s proportional to \\(p(\\theta|y) = p(y|\\theta)\\times p(\\theta)\\) \\(p(y|\\theta)\\) is what we max when we do ML $ p()$: prior distribution capturing beliefs about \\(\\theta\\) 17.4.2.1 So how do we estimate it? Specify a probability model, a distribution for Y (likelihood function) and the priors for \\(\\theta\\) Solve (find) the posterior distribution \\(p(\\theta|Y)\\) and summarise the parameters of interest In practice, step 2 is usually done via MCMC simulation rather than analytically. … via simulations, I approach the ‘true’ value on \\(\\theta\\) (Given ‘regularity conditions’) 17.4.2.2 Linear regression model example \\[Y = x&#39;\\beta+\\epsilon\\] with n obs only random term is epsilon … natural candidate is a normal distribution, so \\(Y \\sim N(x&#39;\\beta,\\sigma^2_e)\\) So we want to find \\(p(\\beta, \\sigma^2_\\epsilon|Y,X)\\). This depends on the choices of \\(p(\\beta)\\) and \\(p(\\epsilon)\\). Could choose conjugate priors, leading to a particular joint posterior, you can solve it analytically. Can yield a joint posterior. Instead, let’s assume that the latter (variance) parameter is known, you can show that the posterior for \\(\\beta\\) is also normally distributed. (Conjugate) Similarly, if we assume \\(\\beta\\) is known, if the variance term had an inverse gamma distribution (prior), so will the posterior. In these conjugate priors, the posterior mean will be a weighted average of the priors and the data. 17.4.2.3 Gibbs Needs closed form conditional posterior for every parameter. What Gibbs sampler does is break the parameter space into sets of parameters Choose starting values, \\(\\theta^0_1,...\\theta^0_k\\) sample from the first parameter’s distribution given the others … the second one, … the k’th one . Repeat step 2 … thousands of times (starting with the parameters from the previous iteration) Eventually ‘we obtain samples of \\(p(\\theta|y)\\)’ But if we don’t have a closed form, we cannot simply sample from known distributions in each step E.g., in case of Logit distribution. 17.4.2.4 Metropolis Hastings Choose ‘proposal distribution’ to sample parameter values (a candidate like normal, uniform) Start w a prelim guess for parameter values \\(\\theta_0\\) At iteration t sample a proposal \\(\\theta_t\\) from \\(p(\\theta_t|\\theta_{t-1})\\) ?? what does this come from? If \\(p(\\theta_t|y)&gt;p(\\theta_{t-1}|y)\\) accept it as the new value of \\(\\theta\\). ??? how is this computed if we don’t have conjugate closed-form posteriors? Otherwise flip a coin with probability r = (ratio of those probabilities) if coin tosses heads, accept as new theta, otherwise stay at previous theta allows algorithm to avoid getting stuck at local maxima Commonly used proposal: random walk sample: \\(\\theta_t=\\theta_{t-1}+z_t\\), \\(z_t \\sim f\\) ?? I do this because there is no analytical way to derive this, unlike in the conjugate case, where we might use the Gibbs can combine Gibbs with Metropolis steps; relevant to some problems 17.4.2.5 Assessing convergence previous … ‘eyeballing’ formal: single-chain tests (Geweke/Heidel) … is the last part of the chain stable (stationary)… compare simulation at middle and end, is there much variation? multiple-chain test… (starting from different values), do they end similar … Gelman-Rubin diagnosting \\(\\hat{R}\\) typically either a very long chain and use GH convergence, or multiple shorter chains and use \\(\\hat{R}\\) Gabriel: Gelman-Rubin is probably preferred; more conservative ?? What am I iterating towards? Converging on what? 17.4.2.6 Assesing ‘fit’ in Bayesian No r-squared Typical measure is ‘posterior predictive comparisons’ \\(p(y_{replicated}|y_{observed}= ...\\) Simulate data from estimated parameters Compare to observed data Use an overall fit measure to assess model fit E.g., percent correct predictions (binary), whether the true data is within the 95% CI of the replicates, deviance For each replicate Choose statistic D, compare the replicated \\(D(y^s_{replicated})\\) against \\(D(y^s_{observed})\\) Quantify the discrepancy … percent of correct predictions, proportion of times replicated y is below true y … compute ‘bayesian p-value’s’ Systematic differences between replicate and actual data indicate model limitations (?? what are reasonable values here??) 17.4.3 Comparing models … Equivalent of ‘likelihood’ ‘Deviance Information Criterion’ (most used); specific for MCMC simulations: compares expected LL of the model (of the data given the estimated parameters; average here across much of the later points in the chain) against the llhd at the posterior parameter mean. Always select model with lowest DIC. Bayes Factor (less used): Ratio of llhd of the models; higher BF means model is more supported; BF&gt;10 seen to provide strong evidence for model w higher value 17.4.4 On choosing priors Most social scientists use non-informative or vague priors; i.e., large variance… e.g., \\(\\beta \\sim N(0,1000)\\) But its often useful to incorporate information into your priors Small pilot to test, \\(\\rightarrow\\) data \\(Y_1\\), another study gives data \\(Y_2\\); repeated application of Bayes theorem gives the posterior. Same result whether you obtained these together, or whether you did one and then updated (e.g., via an MCMC, starting with the first one as a prior) Conjugate priors (mentioned before) Jeffrey’s priors (??) 17.4.5 Implementation If you don’t need to do fancy things, and don’t want to (?) generate the full posterior distribution (or something) Some Stata/R commands that make Bayesian look frequentist. In Jags and Winbugs, we only have to specify the prior… rest is done for us Jags is great … you only need to do self-coding with lots of data and super complicated models as it can freeze up We went through it the fancy way in Probit.R Then the easy way with ‘script probit Jags.R’ 17.4.6 Generate predictions from a WinBUGS model You can just generate these outcomes … Prediction: generate a new observation #note, he is doing one per iteration, but since these are convergent it would be basically the same if you just chose a random iteration and did all the draws from that one 17.4.7 Missing data case One solution – multiple imputation choose imputation model to predict missings, generate many copies of orig data set, imputing missibg value for each 2 more steps here Need a model for X|alpha, because missing variables are random variables 17.4.8 Stata Has some rather simple implementations; e.g., just using commands like bayes: regress y x 17.4.9 R mcmc pac Also simple code; great for standard use Speedup with parallelization; see “script for parallel probit.R” and “parallelprobit.R” More advanced: C++; can integrate it with Rcpp, or even use Exeter’s ISCA cluster summary(cars) ## speed dist ## Min. : 4.0 Min. : 2 ## 1st Qu.:12.0 1st Qu.: 26 ## Median :15.0 Median : 36 ## Mean :15.4 Mean : 43 ## 3rd Qu.:19.0 3rd Qu.: 56 ## Max. :25.0 Max. :120 17.5 Other resources and notes to integrate Hey stats twitter: got a very sharp psych UG student wanting to dive into Bayes.

It does a good job of giving actual insight into mathematical, statistical, and data-science techniques, and uses a reasonable amount of actual maths and some literal code. There is ‘meat in this sandwich’. Terms like ‘lift’ As another example, in evaluating the utility of a pattern, we see a notion of lift— how much more prevalent a pattern is than would be expected by chance—recurring broadly across data science. It is used to evaluate very different sorts of patterns in different contexts. Algorithms for targeting advertisements are evaluated by computing the lift one gets for the targeted population. Lift is used to judge the weight of evidence for or against a conclusion. Lift helps determine whether a co-occurrence (an association) in data is interesting, as opposed to simply being a natural consequence of popularity. Ch 1 Introduction: Data-Analytic Thinking A range of examples illustrating applications, techniques, and principles. Example: During Hurricane Frances… predicting demand to gear inventory and avoid shortages … lead to huge profit for Wal-Mart Digging into the day to do some surprising findings:* ’We didn’t know in the past that strawberry PopTarts increase in sales, like seven times their normal sales rate, ahead of a hurricane\" * Strange results like these might seem like examples of overfitting, but it is also seems reasonable that demand patterns may be predictable (using careful data analysis) even if we don’t always have a straightforward intuitive explanation for a ‘mechanism’. Classification and class probability estimation attempt to predict, for each individual in a population, which of a (small) set of classes this individual belongs to. Usually the classes are mutually exclusive. An example classification question would be: “Among all the customers of MegaTelCo, which are likely to respond to a given offer?” In this example the two classes could be called will respond and will not respond. Example: Predicting Customer Churn Customers switching from one company to another is called churn, Your task is to devise a precise, step-by-step plan for how the data science team should use MegaTelCo’s vast data resources to decide which customers should be offered the special retention deal prior to the expiration of their contracts 18.1.1 Data Science, Engineering, and Data-Driven Decision Making They show that statistically, the more data-driven a firm is, the more productive it is—even controlling for a wide range of possible confounding factors. And the differences are not small. One standard deviation higher on the DDD scale is associated with a 4%–6% increase in productivity. DDD also is correlated with higher return on assets, return on equity, asset utilization, and market value, and the relationship seems to be causal.* * DR: I am still somewhat skeptical of the causality here! Two types of decisions that data analysis can benefit: decisions for which “discoveries” need to be made within data, and (2) decisions that repeat, especially at massive scale, and so decision-making can benefit from even small increases in decision-making accuracy based on data analysis Getting the jump on the competition … Target wanted to get a jump on their competition. They were interested in whether they could predict that people are expecting a baby. If they could, they would gain an advantage by making offers before their competitors. Using techniques of data science, Target analyzed historical data on customers who later were revealed to have been pregnant, and were able to extract information that could predict which consumers were pregnant. For example, pregnant mothers often change their diets, their wardrobes, their vitamin regimens, and so on. These indicators could be extracted from historical data, assembled into predictive models, and then deployed in marketing campaigns. 18.1.2 Data Processing and “Big Data” 18.1.3 Data and Data Science Capability as a Strategic Asset data, and the capability to extract useful knowledge from data, should be regarded as key strategic assets. Signet Bank from the 1990s … a key example of ‘data as a strategic asset’ , but at the time, credit cards essentially had uniform pricing, for two reasons: (1) … [lack of] information systems to deal with differential pricing at massive scale, and (2) bank management believed customers would not stand for price discrimination. A realization: with their data assets, [they] could do more sophisticated predictive modeling… and offer different terms (nowadays: pricing, credit limits, low-initial-rate bal‐ ance transfers, cash back, loyalty points, and so on) Economic insight: model profitability, not just default probability They knew that a small proportion of customers actually account for more than 100% of a bank’s profit from credit card operations (because the rest are break-even or money-losing). If they could model profitability, they could make better offers to the best customers and “skim the cream” of the big banks’ clientele “Fundamental strategy of data science: acquire the necessary data at a cost” Different terms were offered at random to different customers. This may seem foolish outside the context of data-analytic thinking: you’re likely to lose money! This is true. In this case, losses are the cost of data acquisition. Losses continued for a few years while the data scientists worked to build predictive models from the data,* * This falls under the category of ‘experimentation’, ‘A/B testing’, or ‘split testing’. In general, more efficient experimentation will be ‘adaptive, involving optimal dynamic allocation into different “treatments”. Algorithm-wise, this is a ’multi-armed bandit’ problem. Popular discussion of this: (Christian and Griffiths 2016), chapter 2 “Explore/Exploit”. Evidence for this? Studies giving clear quantitative demonstrations of the value of a data asset are hard to find, primarily because firms are hesitant to divulge results of strategic value. The huge valuation of Facebook has been credited to its vast and unique data assets (Sengupta, 2012), including both information about individuals and their likes, as well as information about the structure of the social network. Information about network structure has been shown to be important to predicting and has been shown to be remarkably helpful in building models of who will buy certain products (Hill, Provost, &amp; Volinsky, 2006). 18.1.4 Data-Analytic Thinking Why business people need to understand data science E.g., in making valuations based on data assets: venture capitalists must be able to invest wisely in businesses with substantial data assets, and business strategists must be able to devise plans that exploit data. More details and examples (unfold) As a few examples, if a consultant presents a proposal to mine a data asset to improve your business, you should be able to assess whether the proposal makes sense. If a competitor announces a new data partnership, you should recognize when it may put you at a strategic disadvantage. Or, let’s say you take a position with a venture firm and your first project is to assess the potential for investing in an advertising company. The founders present a convincing argument that they will realize significant value from a unique body of data they will collect, and on that basis are arguing for a substantially higher valuation. Is this reasonable? With an understanding of the fundamentals of data science you should be able to devise a few probing questions to determine whether their valuation arguments are plausible. And employees interact with these issues: Data analytics projects reach into all business units. Employees throughout these units must interact with the data science team. If these employees do not have a fundamental grounding in the principles of data analytic thinking, they will not really understand what is happening in the business 18.1.5 Data Mining and Data Science, Revisited … Extraction of useful (nontrivial, hopefully actionable) patterns or models from large bodies of data Fundamental concept: Extracting useful knowledge from data to solve business problems can be treated systematically by following a process with reasonably well-defined stages.* * “The Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining, abbreviated CRISP-DM (CRISPDM Project, 2000), is one codification of this process” Key principle: Overfitting The concept of overfitting and its avoidance permeates data science processes, algorithms, and evaluation methods Chapter 5 is devoted to this.** ** (Christian and Griffiths 2016) also have a chapter on overfitting, but in parts they confound overfitting with the complexity of models. Even very simple models, e.g. involving only one feature and one outcome of interest, can be substantially overfit, while complicated models with many features and parameters can be “penalized” (using techniques such as ridge regression) and validated to detect and avoid overfitting. Quantify the benefits of using data For our churn-management example, how exactly are we going to use the patterns extracted from historical data? Should the value of the customer be taken into account in addition to the likelihood of leaving? More generally, does the pattern lead to better decisions than some reasonable alternative? How well would one have done by chance? How well would one do with a smart “default” alternative? The point: it is costly/time-consuming to maintain and analyze data. Thus it is important to continually assess whether this process is yielding value for money. 18.2 Ch 2 Business Problems and Data Science Solutions A critical skill in data science is the ability to decompose a data analytics problem into pieces such that each piece matches a known task for which tools are available. Examples of some techniques and applications below… 18.2.1 Types of problems and approaches Classification and class probability estimation Example: “Among all the customers of MegaTelCo, which are likely to respond to a given offer?” … for each individual in a population, which of a (small) set of classes this individual belongs to. Usually the classes are mutually exclusive. An example classification question would be: “Among all the customers of MegaTelCo, which are likely to respond to a given offer?” In this example the two classes could be called will respond and will not respond. Some specific techniques: Logit, Multinomial logit, etc. A score or class probability is a more informative measure, that can also be used for classification: A scoring model applied to an individual produces, instead of a class prediction, a score representing the probability (or some other quantification of likelihood) that that individual belongs to each class. In our customer response scenario, a scoring model would be able to evaluate each individual customer and produce a score of how likely each is to respond to the offer. Regression (“value estimation”) * Regression (“value estimation”) attempts to estimate or predict, for each individual, the numerical value of some variable for that individual. An example regression question would be: “How much will a given customer use the service?” * (Linear) regression is probably the tool that academics are most familiar with. The idea of a ‘line’ (or plane) of best fit, is ubiquitous, and one of the major concepts taught in basic statistics and econometrics. Of course it has a million flavors and issues. Here we are less interested in explaining a particular dataset as we are in extracting patterns that will generalize to other data, and for the purpose of improving some business process. DR: The above seems wrong – this is not what regression analysis does, without many further assumptions! OF: This section notes that regression analysis is used for prediction rather than inference. Hence the use of models to predict new cases rather than provide inference. Similarity matching Similarity matching attempts to identify similar individuals based on data known about them. Similarity matching can be used directly to find similar entities. For example, IBM is interested in finding companies similar to their best business customers, in order to focus their sales force on the best opportunities one of the most popular methods for making product recommendations (finding people who are similar to you in terms of the products they have liked or have purchased) DR: To me this seems very close to the classification of class probability problem. If I put two people in the same category, I am suggesting that they are similar. However, I can see how this can be done more flexibly; I can be “similar” to someone in many ways and consideringmany dimensions. Clustering … attempts to group individuals in a population together by their similarity, but not driven by any specific purpose. An example clustering question would be: “Do our customers form natural groups or segments?” Clustering is useful in preliminary domain exploration to see which natural groups exist because these groups in turn may suggest other data mining tasks or approaches. * * DR: This seems very similar and related to similarity matching as well as classification. Perhaps the clusterning technique can be used in these problems. Co-occurrence grouping What items are commonly purchased together? Co-occurrence grouping (also known as frequent itemset mining, association rule discovery, and market-basket analysis) attempts to find associations between entities based on transactions involving them. What items are commonly purchased together? While clustering looks at similarity between objects based on the objects’ attributes, co-occurrence grouping considers similarity of objects based on their appearing together in transactions. So, is this indeed a form of clustering or similarity matching? Profiling “What is the typical cell phone usage of this customer segment?” Profiling (also known as behavior description) attempts to characterize the typical behavior of an individual, group, or population. Profiling is often used to establish behavioral norms for anomaly detection applications such as fraud detection … This seems like a ‘descriptive and soft’ measure, but it can also be formalized. Link prediction \"Since you and Karen share 10 friends, maybe you’d like to be Karen’s friend? attempts to predict connections between data items, usually by suggesting that a link should exist, Data reduction attempts to take a large set of data and replace it with a smaller set of data that contains much of the important information in the larger set. Causal modeling Techniques for causal modeling include those involving a substantial investment in data, such as randomized controlled experiments (e.g., so-called “A/B tests”), as well as sophisticated methods for drawing causal conclusions from observational data In all cases, a careful data scientist should always include with a causal conclusion the exact assumptions that must be made in order for the causal conclusion to hold (there always are such assumptions—always ask) Establishing and justifying “causal inference” (also redundantly called “causal effects”) and the ‘identification strategy’ for this, is at the core of modern applied Economics and Econometrics. In fact, economists are often surprised by the emphasis on “prediction without causality” in machine learning and business data science work. Econometric approaches to inferring causality include: Experimentation and exogenous random assignment (arguably the ‘gold standard’) ‘Control strategies’ (to try to ‘hold all observables constant’; sometimes drawing on Machine Learning) Natural experiments and ‘instrumental variables’ approaches (e.g., using the variation driven by seemingly ‘exogenous’ factors such as weather) \"Restrictive’ assumptions about time and the continuity of relationships \\(\\rightarrow\\) ‘difference in differences’, ‘fixed effects’, and ‘regression discontinuity’ approaches Causality is discussed in popular and non-technical work including by Economists (‘Freakonomics’, ‘the Why Axis’…) and more directly, in ‘The Book of Why’ (by Judea Pearl, a computer scientist). For more formal and mathematical treatments, see Pearl’s other work, as well as, in Econometrics, (Angrist and Pischke 2008),(Cunningham 2018; Hernán and Robins 2010). 18.2.1.1 Supervised Versus Unsupervised Methods Metaphorically, a teacher “supervises” the learner by carefully providing target information along with a set of examples. The term ‘label’ is important here:* * A term from Data Science that I’ve not seen in statistics/Econometrics, where we typically refer to an ‘outcome variable’ or ‘dependent variable’. Technically, another condition must be met for supervised data mining: there must be data on the target. The value for the target variable for an individual is often called the individual’s label, emphasizing that often (not always) one must incur expense to actively label the data. DR: I always tell me dissertation and project students to ‘ask a question with a question mark’, and to consider whether the question could even have a meaningful answer. This more or less characterises a supervised problem. A vital part in the early stages of the data mining process is (i) to decide whether the line of attack will be supervised or unsupervised, and (ii) if supervised, to produce a precise definition of a target variable. 18.2.2 The Data Mining Process “The CRISP data mining process” From DS for Business Iterative… questions, data, answers, lather, rinse repeat Business Understanding often the key to a great success is a creative problem formulation by some analyst regarding how to cast the business problem as one or more data science problems. Data Understanding Those who commit fraud are a subset of the legitimate users; there is no separate disinterested party who will declare exactly what the “correct” charges should be. Consequently the Medicare billing data have no reliable target variable indicating fraud, and a supervised learning approach that could work for credit card fraud is not applicable. Such a problem usually requires unsupervised approaches such as profiling, clustering, anomaly detection, and co-occurrence grouping. Data Preparation “Leaks” – variables used in building the model that you can’t actually use in decision-making One very general and important concern during data preparation is to beware of “leaks” (Kaufman et al. 2012). A leak is a situation where a variable collected in historical data gives information on the target variable—information that appears in historical data but is not actually available when the decision has to be made. As an example, when predicting whether at a particular point in time a website visitor would end her session or continue surfing to another page, the variable “total number of webpages visited in the session” is predictive. However, the total number of webpages visited in the session would not be known until after the session was over (Kohavi et al., 2000)—at which point one would know the value for the target variable! As another illustrative example, consider predicting whether a customer will be a “big spender”; knowing the categories of the items purchased (or worse, the amount of tax paid) are very predictive, but are not known at decision-making time (Kohavi &amp; Parekh, 2003). Evaluation assess the data mining results rigorously and to gain confidence that they are valid and reliable before moving test a model first in a controlled laboratory setting. Equally important, the evaluation stage also serves to help ensure that the model satisfies the original business goal A model may be extremely accurate (&gt; 99%) by laboratory standards, but evaluation in the actual business context may reveal that it still produces too many false alarms to be economically feasible. (How much would it cost to provide the staff to deal with all those false alarms? Think about the comprehensibility of the model to stakeholders (not just to the data scientists). Use an experiment to test the model: in some cases we may want to extend evaluation into the development environment, for example by instrumenting a live system to be able to conduct random‐ ized experiments. In our churn example, if we have decided from laboratory tests that a data mined model will give us better churn reduction, we may want to move on to an “in vivo” evaluation, in which a live system randomly applies the model to some cus‐ tomers while keeping other customers as a control group (recall our discussion of causal modeling from Chapter 1). … noting behavior can change—in some cases, like fraud or spam, in direct response to the deployment of models. Deployment In deployment the results of data mining—and increasingly the data mining techniques themselves—are put into real use in order to realize some return on investment. The You may need to ‘deploy the whole data mining system’ (i.e., rebuild the model using newer data?) Two main reasons for deploying the data mining system itself rather than the models produced by a data mining system are (i) the world may change faster than the data science team can adapt, as with fraud and intrusion detection, and (ii) a business has too many modeling tasks for their data science team to manually curate each model individually. Difficulties with ‘over the wall’ transfers: “Your model is not what the data scientists design, it’s what the engineers build.” From a management perspective, it is advisable to have members of the development team involved early on in the data science project. Implications for Managing the Data Science Team data mining is an exploratory undertaking closer to research and development than it is to engineering Other analytics techniques and methods Data Warehousing Database Querying s are available to answer one-off or repeating queries about data posed by an analyst. These tools are usually frontends to database systems, based on Structured Query Language (SQL) or a tool with a graphical user interface (GUI) to help formulate queries (e.g., query-by-example, or QBE). On-line Analytical Processing (OLAP) provides an easy-to-use GUI to query large data collections, for the purpose of facilitating data exploration. Machine Learning and Data Mining because Machine Learning is concerned with many types of performance improvement, it includes subfields such as robotics and computer vision that are not part of KDD. It also is concerned with issues of agency and cognition—how will an intelligent agent use learned knowledge to reason and act in its environment—which are not concerns of Data Mining. Answering Business Questions with These Techniques consider a set of questions that may arise and the technologies that would be appropriate for answering them. These questions are all related but each is subtly different. Who are the most profitable customers? Is there really a difference between the profitable customers and the average customer? But who really are these customers? Can I characterize them? Will some particular new customer be profitable? How much revenue should I expect this customer to generate? 18.3 Ch 3: Introduction to Predictive Modeling: From Correlation to Supervised Segmentation we will begin by thinking of predictive modeling as supervised segmentation—how can we segment the population into groups that differ from each other with respect to some quantity of interest. In particular, how can we segment the population with respect to something that we would like to predict or estimate. Tree induction incorporates the idea of supervised segmentation in an elegant manner, repeatedly selecting informative attributes A descriptive model must be judged in part on its intelligibility, and a less accurate model may be preferred if it is easier to understand. A predictive model may be judged solely on its predictive performance, although we will discuss why intelligibility is nonetheless important 18.3.1 Models, Induction, and Prediction The creation of models from data is known as model induction. Induction is a term from philosophy that refers to generalizing from specific cases to general rules (or laws, or truths). Probability Estimation may be overly optimistic about the probability of class membership for segments with very small numbers of instances. At the extreme, if a leaf happens to have only a single instance, should we be willing to say that there is a 100% probability that members of that segment will have the class that this one instance happens to have? Example: Addressing the Churn Problem with Tree InductionLaplace correction, the purpose of which is to moderate the influence of leaves with only a few instances However, the order in which features are chosen for the tree doesn-t exactly correspond to their ranking in Figure 3-17. Why is this? The answer is that the table ranks each feature by how good it is independently, evaluated separately on the entire population of instances. Nodes in a classification tree depend on the instances above them in the tree. Therefore, except for the root node, features in a classification tree are not evaluated on the entire set of instances 18.3.2 Supervised Segmentation If the segmentation is done using values of variables that will be known when the target is not, then these segments can be used to predict the value of the target variable a formula that evaluates how well each attribute splits a set of examples into segments, with respect to a chosen target variable. Such a formula is based on a purity measure. The most common splitting criterion is called information gain, and it is based on a purity measure called entropy. Disorder corresponds to how mixed (impure) the segment is with respect to these properties of interest. So, for example, a mixed up segment with lots of write-offs and lots of non-write-offs would have high entropy. More technically, entropy is defined as: \\[entropy = - p_1 log (p_1) - p_2 log (p_2) - ... \\] Each \\(p_i\\) is the probability (the relative percentage) of property i within the set. the logarithm is generally taken as base 2. Strictly speaking, information gain measures the change in entropy due to any amount of new information being added; here, in the context of supervised segmentation, we consider the information gained by splitting the set on all values of a single attribute. Information gain resulting from some partitioning of the parent set—how much information has this attribute provided? That depends on how much purer the children are than the parent the entropy for each child \\((c_i)\\) is weighted by the proportion of instances be‐ longing to that child, \\(p(c_i)\\) 18.3.3 Summary Tree induction recursively finds informative attributes for subsets of the data. In so doing it segments the space of instances into similar regions The resulting tree-structured model partitions the space of all possible instances into a set of segments with different predicted values for the target 18.3.4 NOTE – check if there is a gap here 18.4 Ch. 4: Fitting a Model to Data The data miner specifies the form of the model and the attributes; the goal of the data mining is to tune the parameters so that the model fits the data as well as possible. This general approach is called parameter learning or parametric modeling What exactly do we mean when we say a model fits the data well ? The methods here can all be generalized to work with multiple (nonbinary) classes, but the generalization com- plicates the description unnecessarily 18.4.1 Classification via Mathematical Functions because if we take away the axis-parallel boundaries (see Figure 4-2) we can see that there clearly are other, possibly better, ways to partition example, we can separate the instances almost perfectly (by class) if we are allowed to introduce a boundary that is still a straight line, but is not perpendicular to the axes ( dataset of Figure 4-2 with a single linear split. This is called a linear classifier and is essentially a weighted sum of the values for the various attributes, as we will describe next. Linear Discriminant Functions Equation 4-1. Classification function class(-) = { + if 1.0 - Age - 1.5 × Balance + 60 &gt; 0 - if 1.0 × Age - 1.5 × Balance + 60 ≤ 0 This is called a linear discriminant because it discriminates between the classes, and the function of the decision boundary is a linear combination-a weighted sum—of the attributes \\(f(\\cdot) = 60 + 1.0 \\times Age - 1.5 \\times Balance\\) To use this model as a linear discriminant, for a given instance represented by a feature vector x, we check whether f(x) is positive or negative. As discussed above, in the twodimensional case, this corresponds to seeing whether the instance x falls above or below the line We now have a parameterized model: the weights of the linear function (\\(w_i\\)) are the parameters. Roughly, the larger the magnitude of a feature’s weight, the more important that feature is for classifying the target with standardization Optimizing an Objective Function. In fact, there are infinitely many lines (models) that classify this training set perfectly. Which should we pick? underdetermined for Scoring and Ranking InstancesIn other applications, we do not need a precise probability estimate. We simply need a score that will rank cases by the likelihood of belonging to one class or the other. For example, for targeted marketing we may have a limited budget for targeting prospective customers. We would like to have a list of consumers ranked by their predicted likeli- hood of responding positively to our offer for Scoring and Ranking InstancesThus f(x) itself—the output of the linear discriminant function—gives an intuitively satisfying ranking of the instances by their (estimated) likelihood of belong- ing to the class of interest. Support Vector Machines, Briefly In short, support vector machines are linear discriminants SVMs choose based on a simple, elegant idea: instead of thinking about separating with a line, first fit the fattest bar between the classes Then once the widest bar is found, the linear discriminant will be the center line through the bar distance between the dashed parallel lines is called the margin around the linear discriminant, and thus the objective is to maximize the margin. Hopefully they will be distributed similarly to the training data, but they will in fact be different points. In particular, some of the positive examples will likely fall closer to the discriminant boundary than any positive example we have yet seen. All else being equal, the same applies to the negative examples. In other words, they may fall in the margin. The margin-maximizing boundary gives the maximal lee- way for classifying such points original example of Figure 4-2 shows a situa‐ tion in which a single line cannot perfectly separate the data into classes. This is true of most data from complex real-world applications In the case where the data indeed are linearly separable, we incur no penalty and simply maximize the margin. If the data are not linearly separable, the best fit is some balance between a fat margin and a low total error penalty. The penalty for a misclassified point is proportional to the distance from the decision boundary, so if possible the SVM will make only -small\" errors known as hinge loss 18.4.2 Regression via Mathematical Functions Errors have positive distances from the separator in Figure 4-9, while correct classifications have negative distances The hinge loss only becomes positive when an example is on the wrong side of the boundary and beyond the margin. Loss then increases linearly with the example-s distance from the margin, thereby penalizing points more the farther they are from the separating boundary. Zero-one loss, as its name implies, assigns a loss of zero for a correct decision and one for an incorrect decision not sure I get what the margin means here For classification, this would apply large penalties to points far over on the “wrong side” of the separating boundary. Unfortunately, using squared error for classification also penalizes points far on the correct side of the decision boundary principle of thinking carefully about whether the loss function is aligned with the business goal 18.4.3 Class Probability Estimation and Logistic Regression \"More pragmatically, analysts often claim to prefer squared error because it strongly penalizes very large errors. Whether the quadratic penalty is actually appro- priate is specific to each application For least squares regression a serious drawback is that it is very sensitive to the data: erroneous or otherwise outlying data points can severely skew the resultant linear func- tion. For some business applications, we may not have the resources to spend as muchfor systems that build and apply models totally automatically, the modeling needs to be much more robust than when doing a detailed regression analysis -by hand.\" Therefore, for the former application we may want to use a more robust modeling procedure (e.g., use as the objective function absolute error instead of squared error The director of the fraud control operation may want the analysts to focus not simply on the cases most likely to be fraud, but on the cases where the most money is at stake-that is, accounts where the company’s monetary loss is expected to be the highest. For this we need to estimate the actual probability of fraud model designed to give accurate esti‐ mates of class probability. The most common procedure by which we do this is called logistic regression What exactly is an accurate estimate of class membership probability is a subject of debate beyond the scope of this book. Roughly, we would like (i) the probability estimates to be well calibrated, meaning that if you take 100 cases whose class membership probability is estimated to be 0.2, then about 20 of them will actually belong to the class. We would also like (ii) the probability estimates to be discriminative, in that if possible they give meaningfully different probability estimates to different examples. there another representation of the likelihood of an event that we use in everyday life? If we could come up with one that ranges from -∞ to ∞, then we might model this other notion of likelihood with our linear equation The odds of an event is the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of the event not occurring Again, the distance from the boundary is between -∞ and ∞, but as we can see from the example, the odds range from 0 to -. Nonetheless, we can solve our garden-path problem simply by taking the logarithm of the odds (called the -log-odds\"), since for any number in the range 0 to - its log will be between –∞ to ∞. These The output of the logistic regression model is interpreted as the log-odds of class membership 18.4.4 Logistic Regression: Some Technical Details Recall that the distinction between classification and regression is whether the value for the target variable is categorical or numeric Equation 4-4. The logistic function p+ (-) = 1 The model can be applied to the training data to produce estimates that each of the training data points belongs to the target class. What would we want? Ideally, any positive example x+ would have p+ (-+) = 1 and any negative example x• model (set of weights) that gives the highest sum is the model that gives the highest -likelihood\" to the data—the “maximum likeli‐ hood- model. The maximum likelihood model”on average\" gives the highest proba‐ bilities to the positive examples and the lowest probabilities to the negative examples 18.4.5 Example: Logistic Regression versus Tree Induction Though classification trees and linear classifiers both use linear decision boundaries, there are two important differences between them: 1. A classification tree uses decision boundaries that are perpendicular to the instancespace axes (see Figure 4-1), whereas the linear classifier can use decision boundaries of any direction or orientation (see Figure 4-3). This is a direct consequence of the fact that classification trees select a single attribute at a time whereas linear classifiers use a weighted combination of all attributes classification tree is a “piecewise” classifier that segments the instance space re‐ cursively when it has linear classifier places a single decision surface through the entire space. It has great freedom in the orien- tation of the surface, but it is limited to a single division into two segments practically speaking, what are the consequences of these differences? A de‐ cision tree, if it is not too large, may be considerably more understandable to someone without a strong statistics or mathematics background. I’m not convinced. but I can imagine it’s easier to implement in production 18.4.6 Nonlinear Functions, Support Vector Machines, and Neural NetworksThe two most common families of techniques that are based on fitting the parameters of complex, nonlinear functions are nonlinear supportvector machines and neural networks. Support vector machines have a so-called “kernel function” that maps the original features to some other feature space. Then a linear model is fit to this new feature space, just as implement a nonlinear support vector machine with a “polynomial ker‐ nel,- which essentially means it would consider”higher-order\" combinations One can think of a neural network as a -stack\" of models. On the bottom of the stack are the original features. From these features are learned a variety of relatively simple models. Let-s say these are logistic regressions. Then, each subsequent layer in the stack applies a simple model (let-s say, another logistic regression) to the outputs of the next layer down We could think of this very roughly as first creating a set of -experts\" in different facets of the problem (the first-layer models), and then learning how to weight the opinions of these different experts (the second-layer model). more generally with neural networks target labels for training are provided only for the final layer (the actual target variable). The stack of models can be represented by one big parameterized numeric function. The so why consider it in many layers? we can then apply an optimization procedure to find the best parameters to this very complex numeric function When we’re done, we have the parameters to all the models, and thereby have learned the -best\" set of lower-level experts and also the best way to com‐ bine them, all simultaneously \" OF: Neural Networks are made up of layers of perceptrons. These models are given an input vector and assign weights to each input. The inputs are combined into a weighted sum which is passed through an “activation function” that decides on the outcome classification. This method is known as “forward propagation”. A useful analogy from (Melania, 2019): For example, you might get input from several friends on how much they liked a particular movie, but you trust some of those friends’ taste in movies more than others. If the total amount of “friend enthusiasm”—giving more weight to your more trusted friends—is high enough (that is, greater than some unconscious threshold), you decide to go to the movie. This is how a perceptron would decide about movies, if only it had friends. It is the way in which these weights are learned that is both mentally and computationally strenuous. The “back-propagation” algorithm is key to the way that weights are learned. The procedure involves multiple stages. Essentially we initialize our model with a random state, feed our input data in and compute the error that our model has made. Then our model works backwards and updates the weights in a manner which provides a prediction consistent with the true data. This updating process can and often is done multiple times. 18.5 Ch 5: Overfitting and its avoidance 18.5.1 Generalization Generalization is the property of a model or modeling process, whereby the model applies to data that were not used to build the model 18.5.2 Holdout Data and Fitting Graphs These are not the actual use data, for which we ultimately would like to predict the value of the target variable. Instead, creating holdout data is like creating a -lab test\" of generalization performance. We will simulate the use scenario on these holdout data: we will hide from the model (and possibly the modelers) the actual values for the target on the holdout data. The This is known as the base rate, and a classifier that always selects the majority class is called a base rate classifier. A corresponding baseline for a regression model is a simple model that always predicts the mean or median value of the target variable OF: Holdout data focuses around the need to train models on data that is separate from the data a model is tested on. If we didn’t use holdout validation then our data would always seem to perform incredibly well in testing and would perform poorly on new data. 18.5.3 Example: Overfitting Linear Functions In many modern applications, where large numbers of models are built automatically, and/or where there are very large sets of attributes, manual selection may not be feasible. For example, companies that do data science-driven targeting of online display advertisements can build thousands of models each week, sometimes with mil- lions of possible features. In such cases there is no choice but to employ automatic feature selection (or to ignore feature selection all together). 18.5.4 Example: Why Is Overfitting Bad? It does not explain why overfitting often causes models to become worse I guess this is because the meaningless information that is incorporated causes less attention paid to more meaningful information From Holdout Evaluation to Cross-ValidationWhile a holdout set will indeed give us an estimate of generalization performance, it is just a single estimate. Should we have any confidence in a single estimate of model accuracy? It might have just been a single particularly lucky (or unlucky) choice of training and test data 18.5.5 From Holdout Evaluation to Cross-Validation Building the infrastructure for a modeling lab may be costly and time consuming, but after this investment many aspects of model performance can be evaluated quickly in a controlled environment 5-9. An illustration of cross-validation 18.5.6 Learning Curves plot of the generalization performance against the amount of training data is called a learning curve. The asset. The learning curve may show that generalization perforance has leveled off so investing in more training data is probably not worthwhile 18.5.7 Avoiding Overfitting with Tree Induction Overfitting Avoidance and Complexity Control To avoid overfitting, we control the complexity of the models induced from the data. The main problem with tree induction is that it will keep growing the tree to fit the training data until it creates pure leaf nodes to stop growing the tree before it gets too complex, and (ii) to grow the tree until it is too large, then “prune” it back OF: Pruning also has the advantage of improved model interpretation. specify a minimum number of instances that must be present in a leaf. this value is below a threshold (often 5%, but problem specific), then the hypothesis test concludes that the difference is likely not due to chance somewhat imprecise So, for stopping tree growth, an alternative to setting a fixed size for the leaves is to conduct a hypothesis test at every leaf to determine whether the observed difference in (say) information gain could have been due to chance. If the hypothesis test concludes that it was likely not due to chance, then the split is accepted and the tree growing continues. (See -Sidebar: Beware of -multiple comparisons\"\" on page 139.) Overfitting Avoidance and Complexity 18.5.8 A General Method for Avoiding Overfitting One general idea is to estimate whether replacing a set of leaves or a branch with a leaf would reduce accuracy have a collection of models with different complexities, we could choose the best simply by estimating the generalization performance of each. But how could we estimate their generalization performance? On the (labeled) test data? There-s one big problem with that: test data should be strictly independent of model building so that we can get an independent estimate of model accuracy The key is to realize that there was nothing special about the first training/test split we made. Let-s say we are saving the test set for a final assessment. We can take the training set and split it again into a training subset and a testing subset. Then we can build models on this training subset and pick the best model based on this testing subset. Let-s call the former the subtraining set and the latter the validation set for clarity. The validation set is separate from the final test set, on which we are never going to make any modeling decisions. This procedure is often called nested holdout testing. sorts out a key point of confusion 18.5.9 A General Method for Avoiding Overfitting we can induce trees of many complexities from the subtraining set, then we can estimate the generalization performance for each from the validation set Then we could use this model as our best choice, possibly estimating the actual generalization performance on the final holdout But once we-ve chosen the complexity, why not induce a new tree with 122 nodes from the whole, original training set? Then we might get the best of both worlds: using the subtraining/ validation split to pick the best complexity without tainting the test set, and building a model of this best complexity on the entire training set (subtraining plus validation) nested holdout procedure Nested cross-validation example, sequential forward selection (SFS) of features uses a nested holdout pro‐ cedure to first pick the best individual feature, by looking at all models built using just one feature. After i don’t entirely get how the nesting works 18.5.10 Avoiding Overfitting for Parameter Optimization equations, such as logistic regression, that unlike trees do not automatically select what attributes to include, complexity can be controlled by choosing a -right\" set of attributes The general strategy is that instead of just opti‐ mizing the fit to the data, we optimize some combination of fit and simplicity. Models will be better if they fit the data better, but they also will be better if they are simpler. This general methodology is called regularization, a term that is heard often in data science discussions. The rest of Complexity control via regularization works by adding to this objective function a pen‐ alty for complexity: arg max - weight that determines how much importance the optimization procedure should place on the penalty, compared to the data fit. At this point, the mod- eler has to choose - and the penalty function To learn a “regularized” logistic regression model we would instead compute: arg max - most commonly used penalty is the sum of the squares of the weights, sometimes called the -L2-norm\" of w ridge like model linear support vector machine learning is almost equivalent to the L2-regularized logistic re- gression just discussed; the only difference is that a support vector machine uses hinge loss instead of likelihood in its optimization. The support vector machine optimizes this equation: arg max - hinge loss term, is negated because lower hinge loss is better. cross-validation would es‐ sentially conduct automated experiments on subsets of the training data and find a good - value. Then this λ would be used to learn a regularized model on all the training data to optimizing the parameter values of a data mining procedure is known as grid search Sidebar: Beware of “multiple comparisons” index, some will be worse, and some will be better. The best one might be a lot better. Now, you liquidate all the funds but the best few, and you present these to the public. You can -honestly\" claim that their 5-year return is substantially better than the return of the Russell 2000 index. The underlying reasons for overfitting when building models from data are essentially problems of multiple comparisons (Jensen &amp; Cohen, 2000) if the fitting graph truly has an inverted-U-shape, one can be much more confident that the top represents a -good\" complexity than if the curve jumps around randomly e model performance on the training and testing data as a function of model complexity Summary learning curve shows model per‐ formance on testing data plotted against the amount of training data used OF: Note the importance of the bias-variance trade-off. As we increase the flexibility of a model, by for example adding more tree nodes, we decrease the bias but increase the variability. This means that the model will tend to perform poorly on newer data. The relative change of bias and variance helps determine whether the mean-squared error increases or decreases. These will vary across models. Highly non-linear models tend to have higher variation. 18.6 Ch 6.: Similarity, Neighbors, and Clusters Fundamental concepts: Calculating similarity of objects described by data; Using simi‐ larity for prediction; Clustering as similarity-based segmentation. Exemplary techniques: Searching for similar entities; Nearest neighbor methods; Clus- tering methods; Distance metrics for calculating similarity. example, IBM wants to find companies that are similar to their best business customers, in order to have the sales staff look at them as prospects Hewlett-Packard maintains many highperformance servers for clients; this maintenance is aided by a tool that, given a server configuration, retrieves information on other similarly configured servers. Advertisers often want to serve online ads to consumers who are similar to their current good customers. production function example 18.6.1 Similarity and Distance unsupervised segmentation 18.6.2 Similarity and Distance similarity to provide recommen‐ dations of similar products or from similar people The field of Artificial Intelligence has a long history of building systems to help doctors and lawyers with such case-based reasoning. Sim- ilarity judgments are a key component Euclidean distance OF: Because of the mechanics of distance measures we should range-normalize data before using methods such as KNN. This is because the distance measure is affected by the distance between variables, if variables are all on a different scale then this is equivalent to them having different variances. Data doesn’t need to be normalized for methods such as decision trees as information gain is calculated for each individual variable, thus not taking into account the relationship with other variables. The Euclidean and Manhattan distance are special cases of the Minkowski distance. Where the higher the value of \\(p\\) the more emphasis is placed on features with a large difference in the values due to these differences being raised to the \\(p^{th}\\) power \\[ \\text{Minkowski}(\\textbf{a}, \\textbf{b}) = (\\sum_{i=1}^m abs(\\textbf{a}[i]-\\textbf{b}[i])^p)^{1/p} \\] Source: (Kelleher, Mac Namee, and D’Arcy 2015) 18.6.3 Example: Whiskey Analytics This distance is just a number—it has no units, and no meaningful interpretation this needs more explanation… at least discuss standardising these features How can we describe single malt Scotch whiskeys as feature vectors, in such a way that we think similar whiskeys will have similar taste 18.6.4 Nearest Neighbors for Predictive Modeling Legendre’s representation of whiskeys with Euclidean distance to find similar ones for him. how to do with categorical variables?

If we score for the Yes class, so that Yes=1 and No=0, we can average these into a score of 2/3 for David. If we were to do this in practice, we might want to use more than just three nearest neighbors 18.6.5 How Many Neighbors and How Much Influence? assume that David’s three nearest neighbors were again Rachael, John, and Norah. Their respective incomes are 50, 35, and 40 (in thousands). We then use these values to generate a prediction for David-s income. We could use the average (about 42) or the median (40). nn for ’regression,,. kernel models would be an extension of this important to note that in retrieving neighbors we do not use the target variable because we-re trying to predict it Nearest neighbor algorithms are often referred to by the shorthand k-NN, where the k refers to the number of neighbors used, such as 3-NN. nearest-neighbor methods often use weighted voting or similarity moderated voting such that each neighbor-s contribution is scaled by its sim‐ ilarity other sorts of prediction tasks, for example regression and class probability estimation. Generally, we can think of the procedure as weighted scor- ing OF: For classification purposes it is a common rule of thumb to use an odd number as the value for \\(k\\). This is done in order to avoid ties between two label classes. 18.6.6 Geometric Interpretation, Overfitting, and Complexity Control related technique in artificial intelligence is Case-Based Reasoning (Kolodner, 1993; Aamodt &amp; Plaza, 1994), abbreviated CBR relevant to meta analysis?!! Although no explicit boundary is created, there are implicit regions created by instance neighborhoods Figure 6-3. Boundaries created by a 1-NN classifier Note also the one negative instance isolated inside the positive in‐ stances creates a -negative island\" around itself. This point might be considered noise or an outlier, and another model type might smooth over it. generally, irregular concept bound‐ aries are characteristic of all nearest-neighbor classifiers, because they do not impose any particular geometric form on the classifier The 1-NN classifier predicts perfectly for training examples, but it also can make an often reason- able prediction on other examples: it uses the most similar training example. k in a k-NN classifier is a complexity parameter. At one extreme, we can set k = n and we do not allow much complexity at all in our 18.6.7 Issues with Nearest-Neighbor Methods in some fields such as medicine and law, reasoning about similar historical cases is a natural way of coming to a decision about a new case other areas, the lack of an explicit, interpretable model may pose a problem. There are really two aspects to this issue of intelligibility: the justification of a specific decision and the intelligibility of an entire model. With k-NN, it usually is easy to describe how a single instance is decided: the set of neighbors participating in the decision can be presented, along with their contributions. The movie Billy Elliot was recommended based on your interest in Amadeus, The Con‐ stant Gardener and Little Miss Sunshine- e got a recommendation. On the other hand, a mortgage applicant may not be satisfied with the explanation, -We declined your mortgage application because you remind us of the Smiths and the Mitchells, who both defaulted.- Indeed, some legal regulations restrict the sorts of mod‐ els that can be used for credit scoring to models for which very simple explanations can be given based on specific, important variables. For example, with a linear model, one may be able to say: -all else being equal, if your income had been $20,000 higher you would have been granted this particular mortgage. What is difficult is to explain more deeply what “knowledge” has been mined from the data. If a stakeholder asks -What did your system learn from the data about my cus‐ tomers? On what basis does it make its decisions?- there may be no easy answer because there is no explicit model numeric attributes may have vastly different rang‐ es, and unless they are scaled appropriately the effect of one attribute with a wide range can swamp the effect of another with a much smaller range. But scaling example, in the credit card offer domain, a customer database could contain much incidental information such as number of children, length of time at job, house size, median income, make and model of car, average education level, and so on. Conceivably probably most would be irrelevant curse of dimensionality—and this poses problems for nearest neighbor methods feature selection domain knowledge is to tune the similarity/distance function manually. We may know, for example, that the attribute Number of Credit Cards should training is very fast because it usually involves only storing the instances. No effort is expended in creating a model The main computational cost of a nearest neighbor method is borne by the prediction/classifica- tion step, when the database Heterogeneous AttributesThere are techniques for speeding up neighbor retrievals. Specialized data structures like kd-trees and hashing methods (Shakhnarovich, Darrell, &amp; Indyk, 2005; Papadopoulos &amp; Manolopoulos, 2005) are employed in some commerical database and data mining systems to make nearest neighbor queries more efficient 18.6.8 Other Distance Functions Euclidean distance general, intuitive and computationally very fast Euclidean(, ) = ֫  -  ֫ 2 = (x1 - y1) 2 + (x2 - y2) -ٴ + 2 Though Manhattan distance or L1-norm is the sum of the (unsquared) pairwise distances, or taxicab Jaccard distance treats the two objects as sets of characteristics Jaccard distance is the proportion of all the characteristics (that either has) that are shared by the two appropriate for problems where the possession of a common characteristic between two items is important, but the common absence of a characteristic is not Cosine distance is often used in text classification to measure the similarity of two docu‐ ments how different from L2 with normalization? three occurrences of transition, and two occurrences of monetary. Docu‐ ment B contains two occurrences of performance, three occurrences of transition, and no occurrences of monetary. The two documents would be represented as vectors of counts of these three words: A = &lt;7,3,2&gt; and B = &lt;2,3,0&gt;. The cosine distance of the two documents is: dcosine(A, B) = 1 - 7, 3, 2 - 2, 3, 0 - 7, 3, 2 ֫ 2 - ֫ 2, 3, 0 ֫ 2 = 1 - 7 - 2 + 3 · 3 + 2 · 0 49 + 9 + 4 - 4 + 9 = 1 - 23 28.4 - 0.19 is particularly useful when you want to ignore differences in scale across instances-technically, when you want to ignore the magnitude of the vectors. As a concrete example, in text classification you may want to ignore whether one document is much longer than another, and just concentrate on the textual content Other Distance Functions distance or the Levenshtein metric. This metric counts the minimum number of edit operations required to convert one string into the other 18.6.9 Stepping Back: Solving a Business Problem Versus Data Exploration Recall the CRISP data mining process, replicated in Figure 6-15. We should spend as much time as we can in the business understanding/ data understanding mini-cycle, until we have a concrete, specific definition of the prob- lem we are trying to solve. In predictive modeling applications, we are aided by our need to define the target variable precisely, and In our similarity-matching examples, again we had a very concrete notion of what exactly we were looking for: we want to find similar companies to optimize our efforts, and we will define specifically what it means to be similar. What do we do when in the business understanding phase we conclude: we would like to explore our data, possibly with only a vague notion of the exact problem we are solving? The problems to which we apply clustering often fall into this category. We want to perform unsupervised segmentation igure 6-15. The CRISP data mining process finding groups that “naturally” occur (subject, of course, to how we define our similarity measures). 18.6.10 Summary that for problems where we did not achieve a precise formulation of the problem in the early stages of the data mining process, we have to spend more time later in the process-in the Evaluation stage Therefore, for clustering, additional creativity and business knowledge must be applied in the Evaluation stage of the data mining process they settled on five clusters that represented very different consumer credit behavior (e.g., those who spend a lot but pay off their cards in full each month versus those who spend a lot and keep their balance near their credit limit). These different sorts of customers can tolerate very different credit lines (in the two examples, extra care must be taken with the latter to avoid default) They used the knowledge to define a precise predictive mod‐ eling problem: using data that are available at the time of credit approval, predict the probability that a customer will fall into each of these clusters 18.7 Ch. 7. Decision Analytic Thinking I: What Is a Good Model? Fundamental concepts: Careful consideration of what is desired from data science results; Expected value as a key evaluation framework; Consideration of appropriate comparative baselines. Exemplary techniques: Various evaluation metrics; Estimating costs and benefits; Cal- culating expected profit; Creating baseline methods for comparison economics connection Often it is not possible to measure perfectly one-s ultimate goal, for example because the systems are inadequate, or because it is too costly to gather the right data, or because it is difficult to assess causality. So, we might conclude that we need to measure some surrogate for what we’d really like to measure. It is nonetheless crucial to think carefully about what we’d really like to meas‐ ure. If we have to choose a surrogate, we should do it via careful, data-analytic thinking. 18.7.1 Evaluating Classifier we discussed how for evaluation we should use a holdout test set to assess the generalization performance of the model. But how should we measure generalization performance? 18.7.2 The Confusion Matrix Here we will reserve accuracy for its specific technical meaning as the proportion of correct decisions: accuracy = Number of correct decisions made Total number of decisions made This is equal to 1-error rate class con‐ fusion and the confusion matrix, which is one sort of contingency table. A confusion matrix for a problem involving n classes is an n - n matrix with the columns labeled with actual classes and the rows labeled with predicted classes. Each example in a test set has an actual class label as well as the class predicted by the classifier (the predicted class), whose combination determines which matrix cell the instance counts into. For simplicity we will deal with two-class problems having 2 - 2 confusion matrices. making explicit how one class is being confused for another 18.7.3 Problems with Unbalanced Classes Table 7-1. The layout of a 2 × 2 confusion matrix showing Because the unusual or interesting class is rare among the general population, the class distribution is unbal- anced or skewed Consider a domain where the classes appear in a 999:1 ratio. A simple rule-always choose the most prevalent class—gives 99.9% accuracy Chap‐ ter 5 mentioned the -base rate\" of a class, which corresponds to how well a classifier would perform by simply choosing that class for every instance Consider again our cellular-churn example. Let-s say you are a manager at MegaTelCo and as an analyst I report that our churnprediction model generates 80% accuracy. This sounds good, but is it? My coworker reports that her model generates an accuracy of 37%. That-s pretty bad, isn’t it? You might say, wait-we need more information about the data say you know that in these data the baseline churn rate is approximately 10% per month. Let-s consider a customer who churns to be a positive example, so within our population of customers we expect a positive to negative class ratio of 1:9. So if we simply classify everyone as negative we could achieve a base rate accuracy of 90%! My coworker calculated the accuracy on a representative sample from the population, whereas I created artificially balanced datasets for training and testing (both common practices). Now my coworker-s model looks really bad—she could have achieved 90% accuracy, but only got 37%. However, when she applies her model to my balanced data set, she also sees an accuracy of 80% a good practice problem 7-1. Two churn models, A and B, can make an equal number of errors on a bal‐ anced population used for training (top) but a very different number of errors when tes- ted against the true population (bottom accuracy: we don’t know how much we care about the different errors and correct decisions. This 18.7.4 Generalizing Beyond Classification Another problem with simple classification accuracy as a metric is that it makes no distinction between false positive and false negative errors Compare this with the opposite error: a patient who has cancer but she is wrongly told she does not. This is a false negative. This second type of error would mean a person with cancer would miss early detection, which could have far more serious consequences consider the cost of giving a customer a re‐ tention incentive which still results in departure (a false positive error). Compare this with the cost of losing a customer because no incentive was offered (a false negative). Whatever costs you might decide for each, it is unlikely they would be equal; and the errors should be counted separately regardless. hard to imagine any domain in which a decision maker can safely be in‐ different to whether she makes a false positive or a false negative Once aggregated, these will produce an expected profit (or expected benefit or expected cost) estimate for the classifier vital to return to the question: what is important in the application? What is the goal? Are we assessing the results of data mining appropriately given the actual goal?

Is it meaningful? Is there a better met- ric? Hopefully, the analyst has thought this through carefully. It is surprising how often one finds that an analyst has not, and is simply reporting some measure he learned about in a class in school. expected value computation provides a framework that is extremely useful in organizing thinking about data-analytic problems. Specifically, it decomposes data-analytic thinking into (i) the structure of the problem, (ii) the elements of the analysis that can be extracted from the data, and (iii) the elements of the analysis that need to be acquired from other sources (e.g., business knowledge of subject matter experts) In an expected value calculation the possible outcomes of a situation are enumerated. The expected value is then the weighted average of the values of the different possible outcomes, where the weight given to each value is its probability of occurrence. For example, if the outcomes represent different possible levels of profit, an expected profit calculation weights heavily the highly likely levels of profit, while unlikely levels of profit are given little weight. For this book, we will assume that we are considering repeated tasks (like targeting a large number of consumers, or diagnosing a large number of problems) and we are interested in maximizing expected profit.1 Equation 7-1. The general form of an expected value calculation EV = p(o1)- v(o1) + p(o2)· v(o2) + p(o3)· v(o3) … Each oi its probability and v(oi ) is its value The probabilities often can be estimated from the data (ii), but the business values often need to be acquired from other sources ( 18.7.6 Using Expected Value to Frame Classifier Use targeted marketing often the probability of response for any individual consumer is very low-maybe one or two percent—so no consumer may seem like a likely responder. If we choose a -common sense\" threshold of 50% for deciding what a likely responder is, we would probably not target anyone. targeted marketing scenario If the offer is not made to a con‐ sumer, the consumer will not buy the product. We have a model, mined from historical data, that gives an estimated probability of response pR (-) for any consumer whose feature vector description x is given as input so it’s all lift whether to target a particular consumer provides a framework for carrying out the analysis. Specifically, let’s calculate the expected benefit (or cost) of targeting consumer x: Expected benefit of targeting = pR (-)· vR + 1 - pR (-) · vNR where vR is the value we get from a response and vNR is the value we get from no response To be concrete, let’s say that a consumer buys the product for $200 and our productrelated costs are $100. To target the consumer with the offer, we also incur a cost. Let’s say that we mail some flashy marketing materials, and the overall cost including postage is $1, yielding a value (profit) of vR = $99 if the consumer responds (buys the product). Now, what about vNR, the value to us if the consumer does not respond? We still mailed the marketing materials, incurring a cost of $1 or equivalently a benefit of -$1. Now we are ready to say precisely whether we want to target this consumer: do we expect to make a profit? Technically, is the expected value (profit) of targeting greater than zero concrete example 18.7.7 Using Expected Value to Frame Classifier Evaluation With these example values, we should target the consumer as long as the estimated probability of responding is greater than 1% is this not obvious to business people? It is likely that each model will make some decisions better than the other model. What we care about is, in aggregate, how well does each model do: what is its expected value. Figure 7-2. A diagram of the expected value calculation. may be that data on customers’ prior usage can be helpful in this estimation. In many cases, average estimated costs and benefits are used rather than individual-specific costs and benefits, for simplicity of problem formulation and calculation but benefits may be correlated to observables and unobservable s Figure 7-4. A cost-benefit matrix for the targeted marketing example Given a matrix of costs and benefits, these are multiplied cell-wise against the matrix of probabilities, then summed into a final value representing the total expected profit A common way of expressing expected profit is to factor out the probabilities of seeing each class, often referred to as the class priors rule of basic probability is: p(x, y) = p(y)- p(x | y) Equation 7-2. Expected profit equation with priors p(p) and p(n) factored. Expected profit [Formula here] how does better information and forecasting boost payoffs? better to commit or wait to learn? easy mistake in formulating cost-benefit matrices is to \"dou‐ ble count- by putting a benefit in one cell and a negative cost for the same thing in another cell (or vice versa). useful practical test is to compute the benefit improvement for changing the decision on an example test instance improvement in benefit True positive rate and False negative rate refer to the frequency of being correct and incorrect, respectively, when the instance is actually positive: TP/(TP + FN) and FN/(TP + FN). Precision and Recall are often used, especially in text classification and information retrieval. Recall is the same as true positive rate, while precision is TP/(TP 18.7.8 Evaluation, Baseline Performance, and Implications for Investments in Data FP), which is the accuracy over the cases predicted to be positive The F-measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall at a given point, and is: F-measure = 2 - precision -recall precision + recall Practitioners in many fields such as statistics, pattern recognition, and epidemiology speak of the sensitivity and specificity of a classifier: Sensitivity = TN /(TN + FP) = True negative rate = 1 - False positive rate Specificity = TP /(TP + FN ) = True positive rate You may also hear about the positive predictive value, which is the same as precision. Accuracy, as mentioned before, is simply the count of correct decisions divided by the total number of decisions, or: Accuracy = TP + TN what would be a reasonable baseline against which to compare model performance For classification models it is easy to simulate a completely random model and measure its performance There are two basic tests that any weather forecast must pass to demonstrate its merit: It must do better than what meteorologists call persistence: the assumption that the weather will be the same tomorrow (and the next day) as it was today. It must also beat climatology, the long-term historical average of conditions on a particular date in a particular area. For classification tasks, one good baseline is the majority classifier, a naive classifier that always chooses the majority class of the training dataset For regression problems we have a directly analogous baseline: predict the average value over the population (usually the mean or median . If we find the one variable that correlates best with the target, we can build a classification or regression model that uses just that variable, which gives another view of baseline performance: how well does a simple -conditional\" model perform? “decision stump” — a decision tree with only one internal node, the root node Robert Holte (1993) showed that decision stumps often produce quite good baseline performance on many of the test datasets used in machine learning research. data as an asset to be invested in. If you are considering building models that integrate data from various sources, you should compare the result to models built from the individual sources. Often To be thorough, for each data source the data science team should compare a model that uses the source to one that does not Beyond comparing simple models (and reduced-data models), it is often useful to implement simple, inexpensive models based on domain knowledge or -received wisdom\" and evaluate their performance. For example, in one fraud detection application it was commonly believed that most defrauded accounts would experience a sudden increase in usage, and so checking accounts for sudden jumps in volume was sufficient for catching a large proportion of fraud. 18.7.9 Summary They were able to demonstrate that their data mining added significant value beyond this simpler strategy 18.7.10 Ranking Instead of Classifying discussed how the score assigned by a model can be used to compute a decision for each individual case based on its expected value. A different strategy for making decisions is to rank a set of cases by these scores, and then take actions on the cases at the top of the ranked list some reason we may not be able to obtain accurate probability estimates from the classifier. This happens, for example, in targeted marketing applications when one cannot get a sufficiently representative training sample. The classifier scores may still be very useful for deciding which prospects are better than others A common situation is where you have a budget for actions, such as a fixed marketing budget for a campaign, and so you want to target the most promising candidates With a ranking classifier, a classifier plus threshold produces a single confusion matrix. 18.7.11 Profit Curves with a ranking classifier, we can produce a list of instances and their predicted scores, ranked by decreasing score, and then measure the expected profit that would result from choosing each successive cut-point in the list Graphing these values gives us a profit curve Among the classifiers tested here, the one labeled Clas‐ sifier 2 produces the maximum profit of $200 by targeting the top-ranked 50% of con- sumers. If your goal was simply to maximize profit and you had unlimited resources, you should choose Classifier 2, use it to score your population of customers, and target the top half (highest 50%) of customers on the list. If you believe the validation exercise and the cost benefit estimates Now consider a slightly different but very common situation where you’re constrained by a budget. ROC Graphs and Curves The best-performing model at this performance point is Classifier 1. You should use it to score the entire population, then send offers to the highest-ranked 8,000 cus- tomers. justifying the use of a curve 18.8 Contents and consideration 1.

Clustering analysis is a form of unsupervised learning which focuses around splitting data into groups. The aim of this is to identify key patterns in our data. For example: The supermarket Tesco may wish to identify which products are bought together by consumers. Using clustering may reveal that 80% customers who buy bread also buy milk. Insights such as these could be used in order to alter the layout of a supermarket in order to encourage higher spending. Whilst insights such as the one given in the example above are very simple, in larger datasets it can be much more difficult to draw insights such as these. Provided that the correct method is used, clustering is an incredibly powerful tool for exploring big datasets. Clustering uses distance measures in order to group similar observations into clusters. K-Means: - Simple and easy to implement - Efficient - Difficult to know the value of K to specify - Sensitive to the initial points chosen DBSCAN - Very good at dealing with noise - Can handle different shaped clusters - Tends to perform worse when the density of data varies or when data is highly dimensional 7.

Please cover: a) the basics of the intervention being studied; b) the research methodology; c) the results. What is your conclusion on how effective the Paleo diet is at reducing waist circumference? What do you regard as the key strengths and limitations of the evidence and why? Briefly, what are the major uncertainties in your analysis? How could your conclusion be wrong? This will likely involve saying what you explicitly chose not to do and what you do not know. There is some evidence supporting the claim that the ‘Paleo diet’ reduces obesity as measured by waist circumference, at least for certain targeted groups relative to certain ’standard recommended diets. At least a small set of randomized trials have concluded that participants in the “Paleo diet treatment” groups reduced their waist circumference more than those in control groups. This evidence is summarized in the meta-analysis of Manheimer et al. (2015) who report: The Paleolithic diet resulted in greater short-term improvements in metabolic syndrome components than did guideline-based control diets. The available data warrant additional evaluations of the health benefits of Paleolithic nutrition. More recent meta-analyses in reputable journals have also found favorable results (Ghaedi et al. (2019), de Menezes et al. (2019)). According to Scimago, American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (Manheimer et al. (2015)) ranked second among Nutrition and Dietetics journals, Advances in Nutrition (Ghaedi et al. (2019)) is ranked fourth, and Nutrition Journal (de Menezes et al. (2019)) is ranked 35th. However, the Paleo diet remains controversial; it is still referred to as a ‘fad diet’ on Wikipedia (accessed 20 Dec 2020), which claims ‘there is no good evidence that following a paleolithic diet lessens the risk of cardiovascular disease or metabolic syndrome’.* * However, this Wikipedia article references (Ghaedi et al. 2019; Manheimer et al. 2015); both of these meta-analyses would more accurately be characterized as stating that there is some evidence but the results are not yet definitive. (Fenton and Fenton 2016) criticized the Manheimer et al. (2015) meta-analysis, arguing it overstated the findings and citing limitations of the included original studies. *** *** While I agree with some of the conceptual issues (Fenton and Fenton 2016) raise, I find their criticism of the statistics a bit imprecise as well as arbitrary in citing statistical norms without justification. I return to these issues below. In this brief review I: Consider conceptual issues in defining and measuring the ‘impact of a diet’ through standard study methodologies (Focus (as suggested) on the meta-analysis of Manheimer et al. 2015 considering its methods, findings, and limitations)(#limitations-p), [considering key conceptual and statistical issuess]((#man-results), considering the (critiques of Fenton and Fenton 2016 and Manheimer’s responses)(#critiques), as well as other evaluations of this meta-analysis, weighing this evidence in light of a (shallow survey of) the consensus and other meta-analyses. Assess a particularly promising study (Boers et al. 2014) (incorporated into Manheimer et al. (2015)) Disclaimers: (See ‘limitations’ below). 19.1 Conceptual: Thoughts on nutritional studies and meta-analysis issues 19.1.1 Limited compliance; ‘what are we aiming to measure and why?’ Randomized controlled trials on nutrition and diet have important limitations not faced by many other medical RCTs, such as drug trials. Another important limitation: “RCTs of dietary interventions cannot be controlled with true placebos, but rather with certain constraints on nutrient compositions, food groups, or dietary patterns” Schwingshackl et al. (2016). They also cite “lack of double blinding… crossover bias, and high dropout rates”; although dropout (attrition) is not an exclusive problem for dietary studies. Limited compliance is a particularly important issue: not all participants who are assigned to a particular diet will carefully follow this diet. There are ways of tracking compliance (e.g. “Diet-associated biomarkers” such as 24-hour urine checks, which are highly-rated by Schwingshackl et al. (2016)’s Nutrigrade). There are also ways of encouraging and incentivizing compliance, such as providing free food (as in Boers et al. (2014)). However, our consideration of this issue depends on what exactly itis we want to measure, and for what purpose. For example may want to consider either, what I will call… * * Note that my terminology below comes from the “treatment effect” literature in statistics and econometrics, with some slight abuses of terminology. See, e.g., Angrist and Imbens (1995). “Average Treatment Effect (ATE)”: The difference in some medical outcome, averaged over the population of interest… for the ‘Treatment diet’ if consumed exactly as proposed relative to a ‘Control diet.’** ** Even here, there may be some ambiguities that need to be clarified. Should these diets specify exact amounts/calories consumed (‘isocaloric’), or only the types of foods, allowingconsumption as desired? Do we need to ensure that other patterns, such as exercise, are held constant across diets? (One might imagine that with random treatment exercise patterns will be identical on average, however, some diet may give people more energy to do exercise. We need to decide whether this is part of the effect we wish to consider.) or the “Intention to Treat (ITT)” effect: The difference in some medical outcome, averaged over the population of interest… for those assigned to the treatment diet relative to the control diet. The ATE measure would seem to be more relevant: if we want to get at basic biological mechanisms or if we believe we should recommed a ‘best diet’ without adjusting for compliance. * E.g., perhaps we are making recommendations for a context where compliance is not particularly difficult (e.g. perhaps school or military meals). It may also be reasonable to assume that people reading our analysis (e.g., dieters), will already make these self-control considerations themselves, and simply wish to know which diet would ve best, if they could live up to it. On the other hand the ITT measure might be more relevant if we want to consider which diet to propose “for real people to achieve their best outcomes.” However: while the impact of the diet itself (the ATE) might be expected to be fairly uniform, as the basic biological mechanisms will be similar for similar groups of people, I would expect that the ITT measure to have more heterogeneity and variation, as compliance with a particular diet might be expected to vary greatly for a variety of psychological and cultural/lifestyle reasons. Thus the ITT may be more sensitive to the representativeness of our sample of dieters. Given self selection and other issues, it may be extremely difficult to recruit a “nationally representative” sample of the targeted group. In the discussion of Manheimer et al. (2015), it is not clear to me which measure of the studies are targeting. The discussion (“whether Paleolithic nutrition has any effect in improving metabolic risk factors”, emphasis added) seems to suggest that they are considering the ATE. However most of the designs seem to involve simply different recommendations for treatment and control groups; these would seem much more likely to pick up the ITT for their study sample. 19.1.2 Control group: what is being measured? (Time-permitting, I would more carefully consider which ‘control group’ diets are being administered or recommended.) 19.1.3 What is being tested and how broadly should we interpret the results? Broadly, the Paleo diet involves: Multiple differences relative to more traditional diets A series of connected claims about the mechanism by which it achieves benefits, and about nutrition and health in general It is important to note that even if there is clear evidence that (recommending or implementing) the ‘Paleo diet’ causes positive health benefits relative to an older diet: There is some inconsistency and much heterogeneity in the definition of the Paleo diet, as noted by Zazpe et al. (2020), who propose a particular ‘PaleoDiet’ score We don’t know which of the components of the Paleo diet were beneficial (some may even have been harmful, but outweighed by others which were even more strongly beneficial. We don’t have evidence that narrowly supports the claims made by Paleo advocates. Even if elements of the Paleo diet are beneficial, it may be through other mechanisms and channels than those proposed. 19.2 Manheimer et al 19.2.1 Strengths and limitations The authors follow standard protocols and recommendations. However, these systems themselves may merit some further examination.* * E.g., I would like to better understand how the GRADE system used to asses the quality of evidence has determined the weights for different categories of ‘quality’ chosen. Quintana (2015) note “there are more than 80 tools available to assess the quality and risk of bias in observational studies”… Perhaps there are a similar number of tools for RCT studies. They have: Prospectively (in advance) [registered their protocol with PROSPERO](http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO\\*\\* ** This reduces the risk of “hypothesizing after the results are known” … ‘HARKing’ Kerr (1998)\", as noted by Quintana (2015). However it is difficult to verify when a meta-analysis was actually started, even privately. Here pre-registration partially depends on an honor and trust system. Searched a broad collection of appropriate databases: both literature databases such as PubMed and databases of clinical trials They also claim to have contacted “experts in the field” (these should have been named) to consider whether any trials had been overlooked. This seems to have been a well-planned and adequate search, not neglecting the “gray literature” (Paez (2017)) and limiting “file drawer” bias (Kennedy (2004)). They carefully explained their selection method, and illustrated it in a flow diagram. Broadly assessed the quality of the evidence following the GRADE protocol, finding the overall evidence to be of ‘moderate’ quality (for waist circumference). Analyzed the overall evidence using a frequentist Random-Effects model, estimating both a mean effect and a heterogeneity term. I find this approach to be reasonably appropriate, but I would prefer a Bayesian meta-analysis. Plotting the evidence for each outcome with the standard recommended tree plots, clearly depicting the (frequentist) confidence intervals for each study and overall. Presentation, transparency and characterization: My general impression is that they have clearly and cleanly stated their approach and methods, and reasonably characterized their findings, without overstatement.* E.g., they write: Although there is moderate quality evidence from randomized controlled intervention studies to suggest that the Paleolithic diet can improve metabolic syndrome components, we believe that more studies are required before Paleolithic nutrition can be recommended in future guidelines. (p. 928). * However, I would have liked to see their code and data made available, or at least more prominently noted (I may have overlooked it). 19.2.1.1 Limitations Small number of studies, small sample, wide confidence intervals Four RCTs that involved 159 participants were included. The 4 control diets were based on distinct national nutrition guidelines but were broadly similar. As the authors acknowledge, this is a small number of studies and the sample as a whole is rather small. This leads to fairly wide confidence intervals by most measures. As noted below, the evidence does not allow us to rule out heterogeneity across studies. With only a few studies presented, we do not have good sense of how robust these results would be to considering other populations, control diet comparisons, etc. Note: This suggests the limitations of the evidence, not a weakness of the authors’ analysis. To me their inclusion criteria seem reasonable. I agree, e.g., with their decision that: Crossover RCTs were eligible for inclusion, but we used data from only the first phase before the crossover occurred because we considered the risk of carryover effects to be high However, particularly in line with the points made in Schwingshackl et al. (2016), I would like to see a meta-analysis considering not only RCTs but also other reasonable approaches, such as cohort studies. Possible signs of authors’ pre-judgement and funding pressure The study was ‘Supported in part by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine of the US NIH (grant R24 AT001293; EWM)’, a group that I might suspect to be somewhat sympathetic to the anti-establishment linked ‘back to nature’ philosophy of the Paleo diet. 19.2.2 Overall results, interpretation, consideration of evidence presented in Manheimer et al. (2015) I reproduce the most relevant part of Manheimer et al. (2015)’s results below: Figure 19.1: Forest plot from Manheimer et al: Waist circumference In the individual studies, the Paleo diet participants reduced their waist circumference (‘WC’) by an average of 3-11cm, with some differences across studies. For control diet participants the reduction was between 3 and 6 cm on average. The ‘difference in loss’ ranged from a virtual zero with a 95% confidence interval of [-4cm, +4cm] in Boers et al (the study where food was provided) to a 5.5 cm greater loss for Paleo diets (in Mellberg et al). The reported meta-analytic estimate is an average of 2.38 cm greater loss in Paleo relative to the control diet, with a 95% confidence interval [-4.73, -0.04], thus a ‘just significant’ difference at the standard NHST threshold of \\(p&lt;0.05\\). Does this imply a large relative effect of Paleo? Does it bound the effect as ‘small at best’? To consider the magnitude of an effect such as this, it is helpful to consider overall averages and spreads. The average US male WC is roughly 102 cm (Fryar et al. (2018)) and 98 cm for women…* * I could not quickly find a reputable source for averages in Sweden and Netherlands, where most of the studies were conducted, but secondhand reports suggest it is somewhat smaller, perhaps 90 cm. … which (for men) is also approximately the threshold circumference considered a risk factor for metabolic syndrome (accessed 29 Dec 2020). I quickly, (and perhaps incorrectly) imputed a standard-deviation of roughly 52 cm.** ** Drawing from Fryar et al. (2018) statistics, I multiplied the square root of the reported sample size (\\(\\sqrt(43169 )\\)) by the reported standard error of 0.1 (for the table in inches, the figure in the centimeter table didn’t make sense), and converted back to cm. This calculation may be incorrect; I would like to check it, or better still, find some scientific estimates of dispersion measures for this (SD, quantile, IQR, etc.) I would also like to read more about what WC losses are considered normal, reasonable, and substantial in this context. Heterogeneity The evidence also suggest between-study heterogeneity; at least we do not have strong evidence that would allow us to rule this out. Prima facie, we see strong differences between the studies. In particular, the one study with a strongly different methodology (Boers et al), finds a much smaller (near-zero effect). In their formal measures, we see an \\(I^2\\) of 52%, conventionally classified as “moderate heterogeneity”. I believe \\(\\tau^2 of 2.81\\) can be interpreted as a ‘standard deviation in true effect size between studies’ of \\(\\tau =\\) 1.68, which seems, again, ‘moderate’.*** *** I suspect that if we allowed a variety of other methods of estimating and reporting this (including Bayesian) and we reported the confidence/credible intervals on this between-study variance, the results might suggest the possibility of more substantial heterogeneity. Although the NHST for heterogeneity is not significant by standard measures (\\(P=0.10\\)), a simple ‘failure to reject in a diagnostic test’ does not constitute substantial reason to ignore a potentially-important concern.* A ‘failure to reject the null’ is not in itself, strong evidence for the null hypothesis. Among other things, I suspect a lack of power to detect heterogeneity with only four studies. 19.2.3 My rough conclusions from Manheimer et al The above evidence suggests some relative benefit of the Paleo diet, but not an extremely large benefit. To the extent These (3) studies that find greater benefits are ones where compliance is particularly important, while the one study where food is provided (isocaloric for both diets) Does not seem to find a benefit. This casually suggests that ‘easier compliane’ may be one of the major benefits of the Paleo diet relative to a traditional diet, but obviously, more evidence would be needed to support this conclusion. 19.2.4 External critiques and evaluations of Manheimer et al, (esp Fenton) authors’ response (Fenton and Fenton 2016)’s critique of Manheimer et al. (2015)’s focal statistical comparisons appears to result from a mis-reading.* * “We did not report separate tests against baseline within groups as Fenton and Fenton suggest but rather a comparison of the differences in change from baseline between groups.” (Manheimer 2016) Schwingshackl et al. (2016) develops the ‘Nutrigrade’ scoring system for the strength of the evidence presented in a meta-analysis, specifically for nutrition research.* * Note that these scores are not a verdict on the quality of the meta-analysis itself but of the evidence strength presnted within. Their system and relative points system was independently developed; a major point of contrast with GRADE (Guyatt et al. (2008)) seems to be Nutrigrade’s greater valuation of cohort studies relative to RCTs, reflecting some of the rationales mentioned above, such as limited compliance. They ‘Nutrigrade’ the evidence in Manheimer et al. (2015) as 5.75, or ‘Low’, explained as “there is low confidence in the effect estimate; further research will provide important evidence on the confidence and likely change the effect estimate.” Of 10 randomly meta-analysis studies they rated, this was the fifth-highest ‘Nutrigrade’. Overall, the ‘reviews’ of the strength of evidence meta-analysis are fair to middling. All, including the original authors, seem to agree that the “the current evidence on the paleo diet might be considered early or preliminary and that further research is critically needed” (Manheimer (2016)), although there seems to be some disagreement about how promising an avenue this is for further inquiry. 19.3 Other meta-analyses and consideration of the Paleo diet As noted, the Paleo diet is controversial and not widely accepted in the medical profession. As Manheimer et al. (2015) note a 2015 US News and World Report ranking of 35 diets with input from a panel of health experts placed the Paleolithic diet dead last, citing a lack of research evidence that showed clinical benefits. However, more work also seems to support a claim such as ‘recommending the Paleo diet is succesful in reducing waist circumference in the short-term, relative to recommending more traditional diets.’ In particular, Ghaedi et al. (2019) perform a meta-analysis of eight RCT studies (the four considered by Mannheimier et al, plus four more that were conducted since 2015) and find “a [Paleo diet] significantly reduced … waist circumference (WMD = -2.90 cm; 95% CI: -4.51, -1.28 cm)”. These results are rather similar to those of Manheimer et al. (2015). Time-permitting, I would like to examine this meta-analyis in more detail. 19.3.1 Process of finding relevant work (informal) Notes: In the limited time I had available, I did some keyword searches on Google scholar, such as 'paleo diet' AND 'meta-analysis‘andpaleo dietANDrandomized controlled trial`. I also followed a ’snowball’ approach to consider which studies were cited, and which studies cited Manheimer et al. (2015), and the papers most prominently cited within. I did not do the systematically nor did I keep track of my process (as I would do if I were doing this more seriously, e.g., for my own meta-analysis). 19.4 Focus: Boers et al Unlike the other trials considered in Manheimer et al. (2015), Boers et al. (2014) “provided home-delivered Paleolithic and control diet meals to participants”. This permits a more direct examination of what I called the ATE. I expect this effect to be less variable and more generalizable across populations, because issues of differential compliance will be reduced. This study is also particular strong because it has (apparently) a zero attrition rate (‘34/34 analyzed’), while attrition in the other cited studies is substantial. Particular forms of non-random attrition can strongly bias estimated treatment effects, biasing both the ATE and ITT mentioned above.* * See 1 for a clear discussion of this, as well as an approach to ‘bounding this bias’ under a particular monotonicity assumption. 19.5 Overall analysis My overall impression from the above is that the meta-analytic results do suggest some benefit of the Paleo diet in reducing waist circumference for groups that are vulnerable to the metabolic syndrome. However: The evidence plausibly suggests that the benefit of this diet comes largely through greater adherence, rather than through a direct nutritional advantage. Perhaps, as is popular conventional wisdom “eating more proteinssimply makes it easier to feel full and thus not overeat”. The studies I have seen compare the diet only to a traditional diet, rather than to another low carbohydrate diet. Thus, I do not see any strong evidence that the Paleo diet offers advantages (or disadvantages) over, e.g., the ‘South Beach’ or ‘Keto’ diets. Thus the evidence does not support (nor refute) the mechanism and diet philopsophy behind Paleo. Furthermore, there also appears to be limited evidence; I am not highly confident in even the above claim. I did not see aa wide array of high-quality studies evaluating the Paleo diet for the relevant large and diverse populations in natural settings. 19.5.1 Limitations and uncertainties to my own analysis; proposed future steps Briefly, what are the major uncertainties in your analysis? How could your conclusion be wrong? This will likely involve saying what you explicitly chose not to do and what you do not know. Caveats: I am an economist, not a nutritionist or a life scientist. While I am working to build up my expertise in this area I have only limited experience conducting and for evaluating meta-analyses. The evaluation here was only a limited and shallow exercise done in a 10 hour window for a specific purpose. I did not do a broad and systematic review of the literature. I was only able to take a narrow focus for this exercise, mainly considering only@manheimerPaleolithicNutritionMetabolic2015 review, as well as some connected work. To gain a more reliable answer to this question, there are a number of further , involving gaining better understanding, digging deeper into the data and analysis, and consulting a range of experts. Some steps I would take Better understand: What is the relevant question? As I suggested above, the nature of evidence that is appropriate will depend on what question is being asked, and what purpose this is being put to. Why do we care about the answer to this? Are we considering recommending this diet to a particular population? How strong incentive/food provision will we be able to provide? Are we deeply interested in the biological mechanisms or the behavioral ones? What do we intend to do with the results of this analysis, i.e., what policy choices will it inform? If I had better answers to question like these, I would know which types of studies to focus on, and how to better consider their results. Pursue a more systematic consideration of the literature and evidence documenting my protocol carefully considering which fields and subfields to focus on discussing my approaches with experts in these fields, seeking their consideration of the points I have made in this essay Pursue a better understanding of the reasoning behind standardized protocols for meta-analysis and ‘bias-assessment’, consulting, e.g., the ‘Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions’ How nutritionists and dieticians differentiate (what I call above) the ITT and ATE The argument for particular meta-analytic approaches in nutrition and health studies (in comparison to my area of greater expertise, economics and social science) More closely inspect and evaluate Manheimer et al. (2015)’s code used for doing the (frequentist) Random-effects meta-analysis, to understand the specific inclusion, variable-coding, and estimator choices, and the sensitivity of the results to this.* * For example, as explained in the excellent tutorial Harrer et al. (2019), there are a range of popular estimators for \\(\\tau^2\\), the variance of the distribution of true effect sizes. There is also some debate over whether random effects is appropriate, particularly because of its sensitivity to small studies. The particularly promising Boers et al. (2014) study as noted above Ghaedi et al. (2019), and de Menezes et al. (2019), and any other promising analyses that come from the aforementioned systematic literature survey.
