(Limited to no focus on structural approaches.) Where we can add value to real econometric practice?? Data: Observational (esp. web-scraped and API data and national surveys/admin data} Experimental: esp. where with multiple crossed arms, and where the ‘cleanest design’ may not be possible Assume familiarity with most basic statistical concepts like ‘bias’, ‘consistency’, and ‘null hypothesis testing.’ However, I will focus on some concepts that seem to often be misunderstood and mis-applied. 2.1 Conceptual 2.1.1 Bayesian vs. frequentist approaches Folder: bayesian Notes: bayes_notes 2.1.2 Causal vs. descriptive; ‘treatment effects’ and the potential outcomes causal model 2.1.2.1 DAGs and Potential outcomes 2.1.3 Theory, restrictions, and ‘structural vs reduced form’ 2.2 Getting, cleaning and using data 2.2.1 Data: What/why/where/how 2.2.2 Good coding practices 2.2.2.1 Organizing a project 2.2.2.2 Dynamic documents (esp Rmd/bookdown) 2.2.3 New tools and approaches to data (esp ‘tidyverse’) 2.2.3.1 Style and consistency Indenting, snake-case,etc 2.2.3.2 Using functions, variable lists, etc., for clean, concise, readable code 2.2.4 Data sharing and integrity 2.3 Control strategies and prediction; Machine Learning approaches ‘Identification’ of causal effects with a control strategy not credible Identification Essentially a ‘control strategy’ is “control for all or most of the reasonable determinants of the independent variable so as to make the remaining unobservable component very small, minimizing the potential for bias in the coefficient of interest”. All of the controls must still be exogenous, otherwise this itself can lead to a bias. There is some discussion of how to validate this approach; see, e.g., (???). 2.3.1 Machine Learning (statistical learning): Lasso, Ridge, and more 2.3.2 Limitations to inference from learning approaches 2.4 Basic regression and statistical inference: Common mistakes and issues Peer effects: Self-selection, Common environment, simultaneity/reflection (Manski paper) Identification Random effects estimators show a lack of robustness Specification Clustering SE is more standard practice OLS/IV estimators not ‘mean effect’ in presence of heterogeneity Power calculations/underpowered Selection bias due to attrition Selection bias due to missing variables – impute these as a solution Signs of p-hacking and specification-hunting Weak diagnostic/identification tests Dropping zeroes in a “loglinear” model is problematic Random effects estimators show a lack of robustness Dropping zeroes in a “loglinear” model is problematic Random effects estimators show a lack of robustness With heterogeneity the simple OLS estimator is not the ‘mean effect’ P_augmented may overstate type-1 error rate Impact size from regression of “log 1+gift amount” Lagged dependent variable and fixed effects –&gt; ‘Nickel bias’ Peer effects: Self-selection, Common environment, simultaneity/reflection (Manski paper) Weak IV bias Bias from selecting instruments and estimating using the same data 2.4.1 “Bad control” (“colliders”) Endogenous control: Are the control variables you use endogenous?

If our technique and identification strategy is valid, and we find estimates with confidence intervals closely down around zero, we may have some confidence that any effect, if it exists, is small, at least in this context. To more robustly assert a \"“zero or minimal effect”\" one would want to find these closely bounded around zero under a variety of conditions for generalizability. In general it is important to distinguish a lack of statistical power from a “tight” and informative null result; essentially by considering confidence intervals (or Bayesian credible intervals). See, e.g., Harms and Lakens (2018), “Making ‘null effects’ informative: statistical techniques and inferential frameworks”.\" Harms-lakens-18 2.4.5.1 Confidence intervals and Bayesian credible intervals 2.4.5.2 Comparing relative parameters E.g., “the treatment had a heterogeneous effect… we see a statistically significant positive effect for women but not for men”. This doesn’t cut it: we need to see a statistical test for the difference in these effects. (And also see caveat about multiple hypothesis testing and ex-post fishing). 2.4.6 Multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) See (???) 2.4.7 Interaction terms and pitfalls 2.4.7.1 ‘Moderators’ Confusion with nonlinearity Moderators: Heterogeneity mixed with nonlinearity/corners In the presence of nonlinearity, e.g., diminishing returns, if outcome ‘starts’ at a higher level for one group (e.g., women), it is hard to disentangle a heterogeneous response to the treatment from ‘the diminishing returns kicking in’.

Where is the burden of proof? Where a particular assumption is critical to identification and inference …Failure to reject the violation of an assumptionis not sufficient to give us confidence that it is satisfied and the results are credible. At several points the authors cite insignificant statistical tests as evidence in support of a substantive model, or of evidence that they do not need to worry about certain confounds. Although the problem of induction is difficult, I find this approach inadequate. Where a negative finding is given as an important result, the authors should also show that their parameter estimate is tightly bounded around zero. Where it is cited as evidence they can ignore a confound, they should provide evidence that they can statistically bound that effect is small enough that it should not reasonably cause an issue (e.g., as using Lee or McNemar bounds for selective attrition/hurdles). 2.6.2 Estimating standard errors 2.6.3 Sensitivity analysis: Interactive presentation 2.7 IV and its many issues 2.7.1 Instrument validity Exogeneity vs. exclusion Very hard to ‘powerfully test’ IV not credible Identification Note that for an instrument to be valid it needs to both be exogenously determined (i.e., not selected in a way related to the outcome of interest) and to also not have a direct effect on the outcome (only an indirect effect through the endogenous variable 2.7.2 Heterogeneity and LATE 2.7.3 Weak instruments, other issues 2.7.4 Reference to the use of IV in experiments/mediation 2.8 Causal pathways: mediation, hurdles, etc. 2.8.1 Mediation modeling 2.8.2 ‘Corner solution’ or hurdle variables and ’Conditional on Positive “Conditional on positive”/“intensive margin” analysis ignores selection “Conditional on positive”/“intensive margin” analysis ignores selection Identification See Angrist and Pischke on “Good CoP, bad CoP”.

Your result (may have) relatively large effect sizes that are still insignificant, which makes me wonder whether it has low power. Low powered studies undermine the reliability of our results. Button et al (2013_ point out that running lower-powered studies reduces the positive predicted value—the probability that a “pos- itive” research finding reflects a true effect—of a typical study reported to find a statistically significant result. In combination with publication bias, this could lead a large rate of type-1 error in our body of scientific knowledge (false-positive cases, where the true effect was null and the authors had a very “lucky” draw). True non-null effects will be underrepresented, as underpowered tests will too-often fail to detect (and publish) these. Furthermore, in both cases (true null, true non-null), underpowered tests will be far more likely to find a significant result when they have a random draw that estimates an effect size substantially larger than the true effect size. Thus, the published evidence base will tend to overstate the size of effects.\" verkaik2016, metzger2015 2.12.2 Power calculations without real data 2.12.3 Power calculations using prior data 2.13 (Experimental) Study design: Identifying meaningful and useful (causal) relationships and parameters 2.13.1 Why run an experiment or study?

Even if the subsequent data suggested a \"“one in a million chance of arising under the null”\" the overall process yields a 5%+ error rate. The NHST frequentist framework can not adjust ex-post to consider the \"“likelihood of the null hypothesis”\" given the observed data, in light of the shocking one-in-a-million result. While Bayesian approaches can address this, we are not highly familiar with these methods; however, we are willing to pursue this if you feel it is appropriate. Considering the calculations in , it is clear that \\(p_{augmented}\\) should the type-1 error of the process if there is a positive probability that after an initial experiment attains p\\(&lt;0.05\\), more data is collected. A headline \\(p&lt;0.05\\) does imply that this result will enter the published record. Referees may be skeptical of other parts of the design or framework or motivation. They may also choose to reject the paper specifically because of this issue; they believe the author would have continued collecting data had the result yielded \\(p&gt;0.05\\), thus they think it is better to demand more evidence or a more stringent critical value. Prompted by the referee, the author may collect more data even though \\(p&lt;0.05\\). Or, she may decide to collect more data even without a referee report/rejection demanding it, for various reasons (as we did after our Valentine’s experiment). Thus, we might imagine that there is some probability that after (e.g.) an initial experiment attaining p&lt;0.05, more data is collected, implying that \\(p_{augmented}\\) as calculated above overstates the type I error rate that would arise from these practices. As referees and editors, we should be concerned about the status of knowledge as accepted by the profession, i.e., in published papers. If we recognize the possibility of data augmentation after any paper is rejected, it might be a better practice to require a significance standard substantially below \\(p=0.05\\), in order to attain a type-1 error rate of 5% or less in our published corpus.\" 2.14.3 Efficient assignment of treatments (Links back to power analyses) 2.15 ‘Experimetrics’ and measurement of treatment effects from RCTs 2.15.1 Which error structure?
