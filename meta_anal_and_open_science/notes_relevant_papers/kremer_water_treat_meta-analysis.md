# Notes Kremer Morbidity Diarhea and water treatment meta-analysis; AFE seminar


Health people are much stricter about preregistration and PaP etc

Prima facie evidence that water treatment and promoting chlorine pills help but:

- survey responses and *actual* behavior seem responsive to surveying
- hard to 'double blind' because of tast of chlorine
- less evidence for outcome of ultimate interest ... child survival; rare outcomes, low power, very expensive
    - reasons to think that the mapping is not clear

Economists have used natural experiments to gain large scale evidence


But also some health papers did find beneficial effects on death but not preregistering this outcome (they focus on diarhea), or individually not significant
Economists tend to use LPM .. Health people use relative risk rates


## The approach here

Meta analysis, especially RE find some large estimates. Much higher than the impact on diahreea * impact on deaths would imply.

Why?

- Publication bias?
- Wide CI here


So they cast a wide net and also  went back to the authors to get microdata (DR: why microdata?)

15 total studies with different treatment approaches.

typical tecnique is to drop studies with 0 deaths in either

Better responses include Bayesian log odds ratio

Presents Forest plots... shaded regions get more weights

\

The relative risk specification 'fits better'; the measure (only measure?) is a lower share of cross-study variation relative to sampling error

Tests for publication bias... results robust to excluding those not pre-specifying
No evidence for publication bias (power?)

## Cost effectiveness

estimated cost/DALY is USD 89.5 -- very cost-effective
