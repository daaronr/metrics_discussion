  {"id":"leeTrainingWagesSample2009","abstract":"This paper empirically assesses the wage effects of the Job Corps program, one of the largest federally funded job training programs in the U.S. Even with the aid of a randomized experiment, the impact of a training program on wages is difficult to study because of sample selection, a pervasive problem in applied microeconometric research. Wage rates are only observed for those who are employed, and employment status itself may be affected by the training program. This paper develops an intuitive trimming procedure for bounding average treatment effects in the presence of sample selection. In contrast to existing methods, the procedure requires neither exclusion restrictions nor a bounded support for the outcome of interest. Identification results, estimators, and their asymptotic distribution are presented. The bounds suggest that the program raised wages, consistent with the notion that the Job Corps raises earnings by increasing human capital, rather than solely through encouraging work. The estimator is generally applicable to typical treatment evaluation problems in which there is nonrandom sample selection/attrition. © 2009 The Review of Economic Studies Limited.","author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"David S."}],"container-title":"Review of Economic Studies","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-937X.2009.00536.x","ISSN":"00346527","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"title":"Training, wages, and sample selection: Estimating sharp bounds on treatment effects","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"Quintana2015","abstract":"Meta-analysis synthesizes a body of research investigating a common research question. Outcomes from meta-analyses provide a more objective and transparent summary of a research area than traditional narrative reviews. Moreover, they are often used to support research grant applications, guide clinical practice and direct health policy. The aim of this article is to provide a practical and nontechnical guide for psychological scientists that outlines the steps involved in planning and performing a meta-analysis of correlational datasets. I provide a supplementary R script to demonstrate each analytical step described in the paper, which is readily adaptable for researchers to use for their analyses. While the worked example is the analysis of correlational dataset, the general meta-analytic process described in this paper is applicable for all types of effect sizes. I also emphasise the importance of meta-analysis protocols and pre-registration to improve transparency and help avoid unintended duplication. An improved understanding this tool will not only help scientists to conduct their own meta-analyses but also improve their evaluation of published meta-analyses.","author":[{"family":"Quintana","given":"Daniel S."}],"container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01549","ISSN":"16641078","issue":"OCT","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"page":"1–9","PMID":"26500598","title":"From pre-registration to publication: A non-technical primer for conducting a meta-analysis to synthesize correlational data","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},
