# Notes on Manheimer et al "Paleolithic nutrition for metabolic syndrome: systematic review and meta-analysis", Am J Clin Nutr 2015

@manheimerPaleolithicNutritionMetabolic2015


Objective: We evaluated whether a Paleolithic nutritional pattern improves risk factors for chronic disease more than do other dietary interventions


> in participants with one or more of the 5 components of metabolic syndrome


> random-effects model

assessed risk of bias
- how? subjective assesment based on a standard ('GRADE'?) matrix


> The quality of the evidence was rated with the use of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach
- and how weighted?


> Four RCTs that involved 159 participants were included. The 4 control diets were based on distinct national nutrition guidelines but were broadly similar.

- small control... standard recommendations.. adherence?


>  (mean difference: 22.38 cm; 95% CI: 24.73, 20.04 cm
- credible intervals?


> triglycerides (20.40 mmol/L; 95% CI: 20.76, 20.04 mmol
- meaningful magnitudes?


> triglycerides (20.40 mmol/L; 95% CI: 20.76, 20.04 mmol


> The quality of the evidence for each of the 5 metabolic components was moderate


> registered at PROSPERO


> epidemiologic studies have consistently revealed that every single risk factor raises risks of diabetes and cardiovascular disease independent of the status of the other risk factors (2, 3 -

- pressure?


> 2015 US News and World Report ranking of 35 diets with input from a panel of health experts placed the Paleolithic diet dead last, citing a lack of research evidence that showed clinical benefits (1 -


> that Paleolithic nutrition improves risk factors for chronic disease more than do other dietary interventions in people with one or more components of the metabolic syndrome -

> databases of ongoing trials

- this should reduce the gray literature and file drawer issues


> We included RCTs that compared Paleolithic nutrition with any other dietary intervention in participants with one or more of the 5 components of the metabolic syndrome (see Outcomes) but without a chronic (progressive) disease

- too limited? how much was a excluded here?


> Crossover RCTs were eligible for inclusion, but we used data from only the first phase before the crossover occurred because we considered the risk of carryover effects to be high

- good


> For the comparison of the Paleolithic diet with the control diet, we included both isocaloric and ad libitum designs. Isocaloric diets are designed to have the same number of calories in each group. Ad libitum designs impose no calorie restriction in either group. We prespecified a minimum duration of the dietary intervention of 1 wk -



> To assess risk of bias, we used the Cochrane Collaboration's domain-based evaluation tool as described in Chapter 8, Section 8.5, in the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions

suited to answer this question becausethey have higher compliance
and fewer losses to follow-up

> We used individual patient data for any trials with discrepancies in the published analysis (15).

> Control-diet nutritional patterns were, in general, similar across RCTs. They all advocated increased consumption of cereals and low-fat dairy products, the restriction of saturated fat from ,10% (15, 17, 18) to 15% (16) of total daily energy, and the allowance of refined vegetable oils and processed foods -

> In 3 trials (15, 16, 18), the intervention was dietary information
and advice -

> The trial of Boers et al. (17) provided home-delivered Paleolithic- and control diet meals to participants

- focus on this one


> and allocation concealment
- ??


> The lack of blinding of participants and personnel in all RCTs might possibly have influenced how patients were treated by the physician and other study personnel (i.e., performance bias); therefore, we judged this domain as having unclear risk of bias for all 4 RCTs

- somewhat dubious?


>  effects on primary outcomes were not associated with durations as evidenced by the relatively homogeneous and consistent benefits across RCTs and outcomes (Figure 3)


> with the exception of greater improvements in triglycerides relative to control with home delivery (I 2 test for subgroup difference = 85.6%

- what about waist?  also did they do any formal  tests of these differences?
