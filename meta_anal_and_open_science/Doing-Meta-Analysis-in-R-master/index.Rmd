# About this Guide

![](_figs/coverbild.jpg)

```{block,type='rmdinfo'}
This guide shows you how to conduct meta-analyses in *R* from scratch. The focus of this guide is primarily on clinical outcome research in psychology. It was designed for staff and collaborators of the [**Protect Lab**](https://www.protectlab.org), which is headed by **Prof. Dr. David D. Ebert**.

#### The guide will show you how to: {-}
 
* Get *R* and **RStudio** set for your Meta-Analysis.
* Get your data into *R*.
* **Prepare your data** for the meta-analysis.
* Install and use the `dmetar` *R* package we built specifically for this guide.
* Perform **fixed-effect** and **random-effects** meta-analysis using the `meta` and `metafor` packages.
* Analyse the **heterogeneity** of your results.
* Tackle heterogeneity using **subgroup analyses** and **meta-regression**.
* Check if **selective outcome reporting (publication bias)**  or $p$**-hacking** is present in your data.
* Summarize the **risk of bias** of your study material.
* Calculate the **power** of a meta-analysis.
* **Convert effect sizes** reported in original studies to the ones you need for your meta-analysis.
* Do advanced types of meta-analyses, such as 
    + **multilevel meta-analyses**
    + **multivariate meta-analyses**
    + **meta-analytic structural equation modeling** or
    + **network meta-analyses**.

#### What this guide will not cover {-}

Although this guide will provide some information on the statistics behind meta-analysis, it will not give you an **in-depth introduction** into how meta-analyses are calculated statistically.
  
It is also beyond the scope of this guide to advise in detail which meta-analytical strategy is suited best in which contexts, and on how the search, study inclusion and reporting of meta-analyses should be conducted. The [*Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions*](http://handbook-5-1.cochrane.org/), however, should be a great source to find more information on these topics.

#### Other sources to recommend when conducting Meta-Analyses {-}
  
* If you are looking for an easily digestable, hands-on introduction on how Meta-Analyses are conducted, we can recommend **Pim Cuijpers' online courses on meta-analysis**. The courses are freely available on YouTube. To have a look, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP7_VBrG_TY&list=PL-h5cI5Bkvt0J-O0kq_9J9_aksWFPgR7s). The course is based on a **book** [@cuijpers2016meta], which you can download for free [here](http://bit.do/meta-analysis).
* If you are interested in more details on how to conduct meta-analyses in *R*, you can either have a look at Wolfgang Viechtbauer's webpage for the `metafor` package ([Link](http://metafor-project.org)). Or you can consult a book written by Schwarzer and colleagues on the `meta` package [@schwarzer2015meta]. We can also recommend a book written by **Terri Pigott**, which focuses more on the theoretical background of and advances in meta-analytic techniques [@pigott2012advances].

**How to get the R code for this guide**

![](_figs/githublogo.png)

All code behind this book is available online on **GitHub**. We have created a website containing a **download link** for all material, and a **quick guide** on how to get the *R* code presented in this book running on your computer. The site can be found [here](https://mathiasharrer.github.io/Doing-Meta-Analysis-in-R/).
