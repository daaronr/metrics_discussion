**Which method should i use for my meta-analysis?**

While recent research suggests that the conventional **small-study effect methods** may have substantial **limitations**, and that **p-Curve** may be able to estimate the true effect with less bias [@simonsohn2014p;@simonsohn2015better;@simonsohn2014pb], please note that both methods are based on different **theoretical assumptions** about the origin of publication bias. As we cannot ultimately decide which assumption is the **"true"** one in specific research fields, and, in practice **the true effect is unkown when doing meta-analysis**, we argue that you may use **both methods** and compare results as **sensitivity analyses** [@harrer2019internet].

**P-curve** was developed with **full-blown experimental psychological research in mind**, in which researchers often have **high degrees of "researcher freedom"** [@simmons2011false] in deleting outliers and performing statistical test on their data.

We argue that this looks slightly different for **clinical psychology** and the medical field, where researchers conduct **randomized controlled trials** whith a clear **primary outcome**: the difference between the control and the intervention group after the treatment. While it is also true for **medicine and clinical psychology that statistical significance plays an important role**, the **effect size** of an intervention is often of greater interest, as **treatments are often compared in terms of their treatment effects** in this field. Furthermore, best practice for randomized controlled trials is to perform **intention-to-treat** analyses, in which all collected data in a trial has to be considered, giving researchers less space to "play around" with their data and perform p-hacking. While we certainly do not want to insinuate that **outcome research in clinical psychology** is free from p-hacking and bad data analysis practices, this should be seen as a **caveat** that the assumptions of the small-study effects methods may be more adequate for clinical psychology than other fields within psychology, especially when **the risk of bias for each study is also taken into account*.
Facing this uncertainty, we think that conducting both analyses and reporting them in our research paper may be the most adequate approach until meta-scientific research gives us more certainty about which **assumption actually best reflects the field of clinical psychology**.
