B.
 the differential gains (from science versus from business) for a homogenous
 group (of compliers)?
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Their setup would seem to imply that 'it could not represent A (not even
 for the compliers only)' unless there were full compliance, rather than
 their weaker Proposition 2, part 3.
 But if it only identifies A, is this of interest (other than to the discussion
 of choice based on comparative/absolute advantage)?

\begin_layout Plain Layout
2.
 Proposition 2, part 3: I believe this is the maintained assumption they
 use in their estimation.
 However, it is easy to imagine very plausible reasons why this should not
 hold.
 Suppose that for outcomes, ignoring noncompliance costs, the returns are
 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{2}>Y_{0}>Y_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Suppose an individual were willing to pay the cost of noncompliance (trying
 again next year) to gain entry to school 2 over school 1, but not to gain
 entry to school 2 over school 0, as the gains are lesser.
 This very reasonable case seems to violate their proposition (
\change_inserted 314122868 1488202740
my algebra is below
\change_unchanged
).
\begin_inset Newline newline

\begin_layout Plain Layout
3.
 Footnote 19: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If the irrelevance condition [Prop 2 part B] does not hold or if individuals
 do not understand the allocation mechanism, then our estimation approach
 should be interpreted as relaxing the constant effects assumption in part
 (i) of Proposition 2 to allow for heterogeneity in payoffs according to
 next-best fields.
 I believe this has a mistake or typo, and may be vestigial from a previous
 working paper.
 It sounds like they are saying 'if the weaker condition does not hold,
 we should interpret our estimates as a relaxation of the stronger assumption'
 ...
 but that doesn't make sense, does it? I think understanding this footnote
 is crucial to understanding how to interpret their results if Prop 2 part
 3 does not hold.

Can you help me understand how to interpret the statement

the gains in earnings to persons choosing science instead of teaching [relative
 to] the gains in earnings to those choosing business instead of teaching
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? Does this refer to a comparison of payoffs to first choices for two distinct
 groups – those who prefer science and those who prefer business, each of
 which may have distinct returns to each of the three courses.
 Or does it, perhaps under specified conditions, represent the differential
 gains (from science versus from business) for some homogenous group?

DR: I think this is the most important question.
 I also want to know what they think about our estimator as the policy-relevant
 impact, but we should first improve our justification and relate it to
 their 2014 paper, cited below.
\begin_inset Newline newline

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
NV: From what they do in the estimation it seems to be two (distinct sub)groups:
 one prefering science over teaching, the other prefering business over
 teaching.
 I think they want to make the claim that even though these are two distinct
 groups, the gains from these two groups can be still compared to each other.
 [DR: Compared in what way, and where do they say this? NV: the comparison
 is that by holding the next-best alternative field fixed-teaching in this
 example- they can make the statement that the gains from getting into business
 (relative to teaching) are larger than the gains from science (relative
 to teaching).
 This comparison shows up in both the modeling part and in the empirical
 part] 
\begin_inset Newline newline

\begin_layout Plain Layout
DR: If we allow heterogeneity in relative payoffs, you need to answer the
 question 'the gains for whom?' In your above language you just say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 the gains from science (relative to teaching)

\begin_layout Plain Layout
NV: It helps me to have their research question in mind, which is different
 from ours.
 I think what they are after is whether individuals sort themselves into
 a field based on comparative advantage or absolute advantage (section X).
 In order to make a statement about sorting on comparative advantage, they
 need to have a comparison of a pair of fields j and k (actually they need
 to have a double comparison, those who prefer j over k and k over j.
 On p.
 1107 (QJE) they explain that this is not entirely trivial since it involves
 multiple cut-offs.)
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

DR: Agreed.
 Getting estimates of relative gains from different pairings for groups
 with different preferences may be relevant to measuring sorting based on
 comparative/absolute advantage.
 However, they seem to sell their results as telling us about more than
 just comparative/absolute advantage.
 To me, the way they describe their results suggests that certain fields
 are more lucrative 
\emph on
for everyone
\emph default
 relative to certain other fields, 
\emph on
regardless of the students' preferences.

In result iii, we assume that if changing z from 0 to 1 (2) does not induce
 an individual to choose treatment 1 (2), then it does not make her choose
 treatment 2 (1) either.
 In our context, for example, this assumption means that if crossing the
 admission cutoff to field 1 does not make an individual choose field 1,
 it does not make her choose field 2 either

\begin_layout Itemize

\change_inserted 314122868 1488209454
DR: This may offer insight – which case are they referring to? One in which
 the threshold scores (
\begin_inset Formula $S_{x}$
\end_inset

) needed for admission to field 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 follow 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{2}>S_{1}>S_{0}$
\end_inset

 and we compare an individual whose score is just above or just below 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{1}?$
\end_inset

 In this case, with a score above 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{1}$
\end_inset

, you can go to 1 or 0 without paying a noncompliance cost.
 The equivalent to my 'counterexample' would be someone who goes to 1 if
 their score is between 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{1}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{2}$
\end_inset

, but goes to 2 (paying a noncompliance cost), if their score is below 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{1}.$
\end_inset

 In this case crossing the threshold (dropping 
\emph on
below 
\emph default
it) for 1 causes you to go to 2 (apparently violating their condition),
 but crossing the threshold from 0 to 1 does cause you to choose 1 (so their
 condition holds).

If we interpret 'crossing the threshold' in a positive direction only then
 the condition described in words would be violated only if he chose 0 when
 
\begin_inset Formula $s<S_{1}$
\end_inset

, and chose 2 when 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{1}<s<S_{2}.$
\end_inset

 I agree that this would not be reasonable under any normal set of preferences.
 (But is this what their assumptions literally describe?)

\change_inserted 314122868 1488204040
Alternately, we could have  
\begin_inset Formula $S_{1}>S_{2}>S_{0}$
\end_inset

; I assume by 'crossing the threshold' they always mean a, single adjacent
 threshold.
 So here we compare the bits in parentheses and the analysis is as in the
 last bullet.
 It depends what you mean by 'crossing the threshold'.

\begin_layout Standard
I interpret this as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

within the group and margin you are looking at, one must assume that someone
 'always complies', i.e., attends the programme they are assigned to no matter
 what, or 'never complies', i.e., goes to their preferred program no matter
 what (I believe these are called 'always takers'
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 However, this is inconsistent with a fairly plausible example I give below;
 would that example apply to your analysis? If the irrelevance condition
 is violated, how can we interpret the estimates? 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NV If the irrelevance condition is violated, KLM interpret their estimates
 as heterogeneous pay-offs, with a null-hypothesis of homogeneous pay-offs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DR: I don't see this; can you explain and cite the part where they say this?
 I think Prop 2 part 3 already allows for heterogeneous payoffs.
 It's part 1 that imposes homogenous payoffs.
 (Also, I don't know what you mean by the null/alternative hypothesis here.)

Conclusion (tentative): The IV technique can consistently estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta^{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta^{2}$
\end_inset

 (returns to 1 versus 0 and for 2 versus zero respectively) for distinct
 populations with 'some' noncompliance ...
 (see table) However, to be able to estimate these returns for the same
 group, to be able to say 'for this group the returns to Science vs Humanities
 exceeds the return to Business vs Humanities'*, one needs full compliance
 for this subset for the conditions of their theorem to work.
 (And with full compliance, one wouldn't need IV, correct?) 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

DR If we don't have the "right kind of compliance" this I don't think this
 allows us to say "OK, but the estimates are valid for compliers" ...
 I think they need these conditions for the estimates to be consistent even
 for compliers.

(Of course there may be weaker sufficient condition they haven't specified).

Payoffs to 2 versus 0 exceed the payoffs to 1 versus 0 across all of those
 choosing 2 and 1 as first choices respectively, i.e.,

OLS estimates of the payoffs to field of study can vary either because of
 selection bias, differences in potential earnings across fields, or differences

Prop 1 intuition: Why should (e.g.) the IV-estimated 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}$
\end_inset

 be affected by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta^{2}$
\end_inset

 (the payoff to 2 relative to 0)? I would have thought the estimated 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}$

 those with NBA=0 and those with NBA=2.
 What does this have to do with the payoffs to 2 versus 0? For this measure,
 are we not simply comparing those, for whatever preference, whose marks
 put them just above or just beow the margin between fields 1 and field
 0 ...
 so they never should enter field 2, I would think.

 If the irrelevance condition (assumption in part three in Prop 2) is meant
 to refer to "where field 1 is preferred over field 0" it should follow
 from an optimizing agent with a fixed 'noncompliance cost', but I do not
 see this state somewhere explicitly.
 (See discussion 'more on proposition 2 part 3' below).
 Let me call this the

 I believe that for each of these parts they mean the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{2}$
\end_inset

 to refer to the IV estimation result where we look at students (with scores
 near the threshold of two fields), 
\emph on
where these fields are adjacent in the student's rankings.

\emph default
 (E.g., if field A requires 90 marks, and the next highest field is B requiring
 80 marks, we look only if students who rank B directly below A in some
 part of their rankings.)

...
 However, for part 1 (homogenous effects) this empirical restriction should
 not matter, while it is critical for part 3.
 For part 3, I believe that with the ordered irrelevance condition assumption,
 looking at this subset means the IV-"LATE" estimator tells me about those
 for whom the condition after the bar holds.
 If I have someone for whom A>B>C or C>A>B, I know that they either comply
 with an assignment to A and to B, or they 'always go to C'.
 If this is the case, the LATE estimator of the returns to A over B tells
 me about the average of those relative returns for compliers who have A>B
 somewhere in their ranking (without any others in between).

 I do see how they can test for constant effects if they assume condition
 3 and produce the estimate mentioned above.
 If 'constant effects' holds, then we can simply add things up and see if
 the sums agree.
 E.g., add 'payoffs to A-B for those with this ranking in one year' to 'payoffs
 to B-C for those with these rankings in some year', and see if they add
 up to 'payoffs to A-C for those with this ranking in some year.'

 I still find it unclear what they're claiming to infer about "“the gains
 in earnings to persons choosing science instead of teaching [relative to]
 the gains in earnings to those choosing business instead of teaching".
 I suspect that statements like “for example, by choosing science instead
 of the humanities, individuals almost triple their earnings early in their
 working career” is overstated and a bit misleading.
 If payoffs are heterogeneous and can vary for people with different first
 and second preferences, and we only observe payoffs for those who 
\emph on
state this particular preference ranking
\emph default
, how can we ever say something about 'average payoffs to A-B for everyone',
 or even for any group including people who did not state this preference
 ordering?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They can do things like in figure IX and examine the "average pay off relative
 to next best field -- for those with these next-best fields -- and compare
 this across (preferred) fields".
 However, this would seem to be vulnerable to their own basic critique --
 we are adding heterogeneous payoffs relative to heterogeneous fields, so
 some may not be informed of any particular labor market returns.

 I still think there is something mis-stated in Footnote 19.
 However, if proposition 2 part 3 now makes more sense, this may be less
 important -- unless our own work violates the equivalent of the assumptions
 of part 3.
 I suspect what they meant was something like
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
If the irrelevance condition does not hold [e.g., because of differential
 non-compliance costs depending on one's allocation] or if individuals do
 not understand the allocation mechanism [?so they don't rank their true

\emph on
[cut: relaxing the constant effects assumption in part (i) of Proposition
 2 to allow for heterogeneity in payoffs according to next-best fields]

 I am fairly sure it is the latter.
 However, they argue the choices are incentive-compatible, so we are getting

 I think their IV estimate is clean if there is non-compliance between first-

 other subjects then I’m not sure if this is a violation of their IV assumption
 (that everything works through the major).

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
DR: Consider an IV model using assignment to instrument completion.
 This IV regression should measure the returns to completion for those 'complier
s' who complete the field if and only if they are assigned to it.
 It's an unbiased measure for these 'compliers', so IV 'works'.
 However, the returns to compliers may differ from the average returns,
 and 'compliers' in more difficult fields are likely to be stronger students
 than compliers in easier fields, so comparing the returns across fields
 is difficult!
