\begin_layout Section
Research question 1: Returns to 'being allowed to enter preferred institution'
 (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

treatment
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and policy variable)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
What are the returns (academic, early income, lifetime income, etc) to winning
 one's first-preferred institution, (and how do these returns differ by
 demographics and the characteristics of that institution?)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We firstly aim to measure the impact of a student being 
\emph on
admitted
\emph default
 to his or her preferred institution, conditional on being admitted to the
 course.
 We can consider this the treatment effect of the variable the policymaker
 has direct control over.
 While we will consider a range of outcomes, we will focus on ``income in
 year t'' for the present discussion.
 Consider the effect of an 
\emph on
exogenous shift 
\emph default
in the treatment from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Treatment = 0: attains permission to attend course in an institution not
 of first preference
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Treatment=1: attains permission to attend course in institution of first-prefere
nce.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 We aim to measure the difference in hypothetical outcomes for a person
 with particular characteristics assigned to Treatment=1 relative to the
 same person assigned to Treatment=0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will use the familiar potential outcomes framework [REF].
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}(A=1,C=1)$
\end_inset

 denote individual i's potential income (at some time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

; we leave off this superscript for now) if she were exogenously assigned
 to be 
\emph on
admitted
\emph default
 to the institution of her first choice 
\begin_inset Formula $(A=1)$
\end_inset

 and the course of her first choice 
\begin_inset Formula $(C=1)$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, we can consider the potential income outcome 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}(A=0,C=1)$
\end_inset

, where she is admitted to her first choice course but 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 her first-choice institution.
 If we consider 'able to attend to first-choice institution' as the treatment
 of interest the effect we are interested in will be simply: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
ATE(X)=E\Big(Y_{i}(A=1,C=1)|X_{i}=X\Big)-E\Big(Y_{i}(A=0,C=1)|X_{i}=X\Big),
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
for some group with relevant covariates 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, for some outcome 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

.
 The policy relevance of this is clear: this tells us the benefit those
 in this group get (in terms of outcome Y) from being given the 
\emph on
opportunity
\emph default
 to attend their preferred institution and their first-preferred course,
 relative to having been given the opportunity to attend their first-choice
 course but not their first-choice institution.
 If policymakers can give more individuals 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

like those in this group
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the opportunity to attend their first choice institution, this is the benefit
 they may be expected to get.
 (This presumes that the institution is not changed in any way by the admission
 of more such students; i.e., the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA;
 Rubin, 1980,1990)).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above objects define treatment effects and differences that may come
 through a variety of channels.
 For example, if we have 
\begin_inset Formula $ATE(X=m)=10$
\end_inset

 this does not tell us that males gain 10 from 
\emph on
completing a particular degree
\emph default
 at their first-choice institution.
 Compliance is an issue: a student admitted to his first-choice institution
 and course may not actually 
\emph on
attend
\emph default
 this institution, nor even this course.
 Students 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 admitted to the preferred institution (in their preferred course) may choose
 not to attend the course at all, and may be more likely to 'drop the course'
 than the institution-winners.
 Even given compliance in terms of attendance, academic success and degree
 completion may vary by institution.
 Thus, the effects of winning first-choice institution may come from several
 channels, including the impact on entering the course, on academic outcomes
 conditional on entering, and possible signalling and human capital benefits
 conditional on completing the course.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, no matter which channels these effects occur through, they are
 still of policy interest.
 If males gain 10 in income from getting their first-choice institution
 (all else equal), it is still a clear benefit to them conferred by the
 admissions process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will also be interested in the differences in this between groups with
 distinct observable characteristics, e.g., for males versus females:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
ATE(X=m)-ATE(X=f)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are further issues when comparing the relevant benefits between groups.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $ATE(X=m)-ATE(X=f)=10-5=5$
\end_inset

, this would not tell us that males gain 5 more than females from attending
 any particular institution (or set of institutions) relative to any other
 particular institution(s).
 While the distribution of institutional preferences should be similar between
 lottery winners and losers (because of the random draw), they need not
 be similar along other characteristics like gender.
 Still, the estimate of the differential benefits are relevant: they tell
 us which groups gain more along which dimensions from being given admissions
 preference.

\begin_layout Standard
We first assume a homogenous (linear or proportional) treatment effect of
 program attributes on individual outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are broadly interested in understanding the effect of university attributes
 on labor market outcomes.
 We estimate the following equation.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y_{icjt}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Q_{jc}+\beta_{2}X_{i}+\mbox{LotteryFirstPreferenceFE}+\mbox{OtherFE}+u_{ijt}

\begin_inset Formula $j$

\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}$

\begin_inset Formula $Q_{jc}$
\end_inset

The program attended is largely self-selected ; hence 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{jc}$

 Thus losers who switch subject in response to the lottery outcome are fine,
 but losers who do not attend Higher Education at all are more difficult.
 Possible ways of addressing this would be (i) to use selected sample of
 those who end up in HE, and argue this does not bias our results substantially,
 potentially using a bounds type analysis (?), (ii) restricting analysis
 to those lotteries where people tend not to drop out of HE altogether.

Because these RD studies necessarily compare the highest scoring students

Our empirical approach has two parts.
 First, we use a stacked regression discontinuity design to identify the
 effect of crossing the threshold for admission to a given type of degree
 on earnings outcomes.
 Second, we use a simple model of earnings determination to outline the
 assumptions needed to recover the earnings effects of admission by selectivity,
 field of study and student characteristics relative to a common outside
 option from the threshold- crossing estimates.

 We find that the earnings returns are largest for compliers who only want
 to participate in a single admission lottery.

 This is due to those with the lowest preferences having worse outcomes

Abstract: This paper uses a unique data set with nearly career-long earnings
 histories to provide evidence on the returns to schooling in current and
 lifetime earnings.
 We use these results to assess the importance of life-cycle bias in earnings
 regressions using current earnings as a proxy for lifetime earnings.
 To account for the endogeneity of schooling, we apply three commonly used
 identification strategies.
 Our estimates demonstrate a strong life-cycle bias, often exceeding the
 bias from assuming that schooling is exogenous.
 We further explore the problems caused by life-cycle bias in research on
 the economic returns to schooling, and discuss possible remedies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The life-cycle bias is minimized when individuals’ earnings are measured
 in their early 30s, and there is a large positive (negative) life-cycle
 bias with earnings measured after age 40 (before age 30).
 A possible remedy for cross-sectional estimates of the returns to schooling
 is to restrict the sample to individuals around age 32–33
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consistent with a story of life-cycle bias, our analysis shows a strong
 positive correlation between the mean age in the sample and the estimated
 returns to schooling.
 Our meta-analysis also reveals that the sample mean age generally exceeds
 the age at which life-cycle bias in our estimates is minimized

 Does it have an effect on income over the long term? On where are you live?
 Does it impact your family outcomes, number of children, etc? In some cases,

Our econometric approach is closest to Angrist's (1990) work using the draft
 lottery and the literature spawned by this as a broad methodological example
 motivating our basic identification strategy.
 However, our data suffers from far less 'noncompliance,' and thus the local
 average treatment effect (LATE) comes closer to the true average treatment
 effect [as our robustness checks show].
 Our key observable outcome variables are income and wealth in particular
 early-career years -- in section XXX we use this to estimate permanent
 (lifetime) income effects.
 The key endogenous independent “treatment” variable is the entrance into
 (or completion of) an educational program, especially medicine.
 The key instrumental variable will be whether a subject had a “winning”
 lottery number (given their category) for the program they applied for
 (in their first year, or in any of their attempts).
 We provide evidence of the random assignment of our instrument through
 demonstrating that within group of applicants to the same programs with
 the same category of test scores, the pre-determined observables and recent
 past histories are very similar.
 We also support the

To reduce noise, we  include additional controls (e.g., test scores and previous
 educational performance, demographics, years and cohort sizes), but these
 are not necessary for the consistency of our estimates.
 We also differentiate our estimates by exogenous observables (e.g., by subject,
 grade category, gender, time period), as well as estimating the latent
 heterogeneity of the effect using quantile treatment effect estimates.

“Clean Instruments”: Will significantly impact completing medical school.
 Among the subset of applicants (?) who applied to medical school X times

 Those who choose to try again (iii, iv; unknown for i) should tend to have
 higher returns to MD (relative to their outside option.
 They may also be more

 In other words (leaving off 'expected value' notation ...

\begin_inset Formula $Y_{30}(X_{3},T_{1})-Y_{30}(X_{3},T_{2})$
\end_inset

>
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{30}(X_{2},T_{1})-Y_{30}(X_{2},T_{2})$
\end_inset

 Other such statements could be made.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{21}Y(X):=Y_{30}(X_{3},T_{1})-Y_{30}(X_{3},T_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 This should allow us to state 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{21}Y(X_{4})>\Delta_{21}Y(X_{3})>\Delta_{21}Y(X_{1})>\Delta_{21}Y(X_{2})$
\end_inset

 Extending this notation, we also expect 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{43}Y(X_{4})>\Delta_{43}Y(X_{3})>\Delta_{43}Y(X_{1})>\Delta_{43}Y(X_{2})$

.
 In fact, we should expect the same ordering in the

 We should also expect a similar orderings for analogous expressions for

 Thus, we may expect
