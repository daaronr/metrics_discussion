 Notes and writings on econometrics and statistics to weave into various content and serve as a discussion board.
 
## Particular foci:
 
 - Efficient experimental design and treatment assignment
 - Causal inference

 - Non-negative and bounded dependent variables
 - Mediation and 'conditional on positive effects'; censoring/attrition; bounding approaches to these (e.g., Lee bounds)
