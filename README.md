# metrics_discussion
 Notes and writings on econometrics and statistics to weave into various content and serve as a discussion board.

## Particular foci:

 - Efficient experimental design and treatment assignment
 - Causal inference
 - Experimetrics
 - Statistical learning (ML)
 - Non-negative and bounded dependent variables
 - Mediation and 'conditional on positive effects'; censoring/attrition; bounding approaches to these (e.g., Lee bounds)
