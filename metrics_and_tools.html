<div id="introduction" class="section level1" number="1">
<h1 number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>My goal in putting this resource is to focus on the practical tools I use and the challenges I (<a href="https://daaronr.github.io/markdown-cv/">David Reinstein</a>) face. But I am open to collaboration with others on this. (Other contributors so far include Gerhard Riener, Oska Fentem, and Scott Dickerson.)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>My focus:</em> Microeconomics, behavioral economics, focus on charitable giving and âreturns to educationâ type of straightforward problems. (Minimal focus on structural approaches.)</p>
<p>What I care about: Where we can <em>add value</em> to real econometric (and statistical, experimental, survey design, and data science) practice?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The data I focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Observational (esp.Â web-scraped and API data and national surveys/admin data)</p></li>
<li><p>Experimental: esp.Â with multiple crossed arms, and where the âcleanest designâ may not be possible</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I will assume familiarity with most basic statistical concepts like âbias,â âconsistency,â and ânull hypothesis testing.â However, I will focus on some concepts that seem to often be misunderstood and mis-applied, and I will give and link definitions as time permits.</p>

## Basic regression and statistical inference: Common mistakes and issues {-}

Simple identification issues: "Bad control" ("colliders"); Endogenous control: Are the control variables you use endogenous? (E.g., because FDI may itself affect GDP per capita)

odMeling choices: Choices of lhs and rhs variables, choice of control variables and interactions, which outcome variable/variables; i

Functional form: Logs and exponentials, Nonlinear modeling (and interpreting coefficients), 'Testing for nonlinear terms'

Missing data


OLS and heterogeneity:  OLS does *not* identify the ATE. See: ['your go-to regression specification is biased...'](http://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/your-go-regression-specification-biased-here-s-simple-way-fix-it?cid=SHR_BlogSiteShare_XX_EXT). Modeling heterogeneity: the limits of Quantile regression.

Interpretation and inference: 

- "Null effects" (or move to previous 'conceptual' chapter), confidence intervals and Bayesian credible intervals
-  Interaction terms and pitfalls
- Comparing relative parameters
-  Multiple hypothesis testing (MHT)
- 'Moderators', confusion with nonlinearity
- Choice of test statistics (including nonparametric)

<p>In many real-world cases we use data and âstatisticsâ <em>not</em> to learn about the world for its own sake, but simply in order to make the âbestâ decision.</p>
<p>These âdecision optimizationâ cases are referred to as âreinforcement learningâ (I think). In collecting data and planning our analysis and experimental interventions (if any), we need not be directly concerned with âstatistical powerâ nor with hypothesis testing for its own sake. We might prefer to learn <em>a little bit</em> about each of many possible options, with a very low chance of finding a âstatistically significant result,â over learning a lot about one or two particular options. See the âmovie titlesâ example discussed in section @ref{#lift-test}.</p>

<p>From MHE:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>some variables are bad controls and should not be included in a regression model even when their inclusion might be expected to change the short regression coefficients. Bad controls are variables that are themselves outcome variables in the notational experiment at hand. That is, bad controls might just as well be dependent variables too."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>â They could also be interpreted as endogenous variables.</p>
<p>Example of looking at a regression of wages in schooling, controlling for college degree completion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once we acknowledge the fact that college affects occupation, comparison of wages by college degree status within occupation are no longer apples to apples, even if college degree completion is randomly assigned."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>â The question here was whether to control for the category of occupation, not the college degree.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is also incorrect to say that the conditional comparison captures the part of the effect of college that is ânot explained by occupationâ â¦ so we would do better to control only for variables that are not themselves caused by education."</p>

<div id="ols-does-not-identify-the-ate" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered">OLS does <em>not</em> identify the ATE</h4>
<p>In general, with heterogeneity, OLS does <em>not</em> identify the ATE. It weights observations from different parts of the sample differently. Parts with greater residual variation in the treatment (outcome) variable are more (less) heavily weighted.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>E.g., if the treatment is binary, the estimator will most heavily weight those parts of the sample where the probability of treatment is closest to 1/2.</p>
</div>
<p>The formula is â¦</p>
<p><br />
</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Some intuition</strong></p>
<p>Why is this the case? The OLS type estimators we are taught in Econometrics are âBLUEâ under the assumption of a <em>single homogenous âeffectâ</em> (the âslopeââ¦ although the discussion itself is often agnostic as to whether this represents a causal effect).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It is âbestâ in a minimizing MSE sense under certain assumptions; in particular, we must also know the true functional form and the set of variables to be included. See âoverfittingâ issues.</p>
<p>In order to have the estimate of the true slope that minimizes the squared errors, OLS (and related estimators like FGLS; as well as 2SLS in a more complicated sense) weights some observations more than others. The âinfluenceâ of an observation on the estimated slope depends on the nature of the variation in the dependent and independent variables in the region that observation is drawn from. Think of drawing a line through a set of points that were drawn with some noise from the true distribution. If you drew it based on a bunch of points (from a region where) the treatment varies very little and the outcomes have a lot of noise, the line you draw will be very sensitive to the latter noise and thus unreliable. So, would optimally âdown-weightâ these observations in drawing the line.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, if the <em>actual</em> slope varies by region, this also means you are under-representing certain regions, and thus getting a biased estimate of the average slope.</p>
</div>
<p>How can we deal with this? If we think that the treatment effect varies with <em>observable</em> variables, we could include âinteractionsâ; essentially making separate estimates of the slope for each share of the population (but potentially allowing other control variables to have a homogenous effects, and pooled or clustered estimation of underlying variance.)</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>â¦Although we may want to consider both overfitting here and the idea that there may be <em>some</em> shared component, so the fully-interacted model may be sub-optimal. See mixed modeling (?)</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, this does not tell us how to recover the <em>average</em> of these slopes (approximately, the ATE). Should we weight each of the slopes by the share of the population that this group represents?</p>
<p>Mechanically, the standard way of estimating and representing these interactions and economics has been with simple dummies (0,1) for each compared group. This yields a âbase groupâ (e.g., males aged 35-60) â this obviously does not recover the average slopeâ as well as the âadjustmentâ coefficients.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Another way of expressing interactions, particularly helpful with multi-level interactions is called âeffect codingâ: each group is coded as a âdifference from 0â (e.g,. with bunarybinary gender data males are -1/2 and females +1/2), before doing the interactions. This could allow for a more straightforward interpretation: at each level, the uninteracted term represents the average treatment effects, and the interacted terms represent adjustments relative to this average. <em>But under which conditions is this in fact the case?</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In particular, we compare treatment effect estimates using a fixed effects estimator (FE) to the average treatment effect (ATE) by replicating eight influential papers from the American Economic Review published between 2004 and 2009.1 Using these examples, we consider a randomized experiment in Section 1 as a case study and, in Section 3, we show generally that heterogeneous treatment effects are common and that the FE and ATE are often different in statistically and economically significant degrees. In all but one paper, there is at least one statistically significant source of treatment effect heterogeneity. In five papers, this heterogeneity induces the ATE to be statistically different from the FE estimate at the 5% level (7 of 8 are statistically different at the 10% level). Five of these differences are economically significant, which we define as an absolute difference exceeding 10%. Based upon these results, we conclude that methods that consistently estimate the ATE offer more interpretable results than standard FE models</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By âFEâ here I think they mean group dummies; they are focused on cross-sectional and not panel data!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While fixed effects permit different mean outcomesamong groups, the estimates of treatment effects are typically required to be the same; in more colloquial terms, the intercepts of the conditional expectation functions may differ, but not the slopes</p>

On the book, I saw the section on the problems of using OLS as an estimator of FE without fully interacting the variables (4.2.4, this blog post), but d
By idnât really understand the issue/intuition behind the problem/solution â I would be keen to chat about what it means.. and if I then get it, would more than happily contribute a lay summary for the book. Also there are three papers by Ferraro (links below) that I think you might find interesting/offer well explained insights into difficulties in how to do empirical econ/problems within it for the Book.

Plus there is this paper â https://www.nber.org/papers/w25636 which applies the changes-in-changes method of Athey and Imbens 2006 a method which (proponents claims) is able to get at heterogeneous treatment effects better than simple DiD by bin/something similar.

<h3 number="3.1.6"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.6</span> âNull effectsâ</h3>
<p>"While the classical statistical framework is not terribly clear about when one should âacceptâ a null hypothesis, we clearly should distinguish strong evidence for a small or zero effect from the evidence and consequent imprecise estimates. If our technique and identification strategy is valid, and we find estimates with confidence intervals closely down around zero, we may have some confidence that any effect, if it exists, is small, at least in this context. To more robustly assert a âzero or minimal effectâ one would want to find these closely bounded around zero under a variety of conditions for generalizability.</p>
<p>In general it is important to distinguish a lack of statistical power from a âtightâ and informative null result; essentially by considering confidence intervals (or Bayesian credible intervals). See, e.g., Harms and Lakens (2018), âMaking ânull effectsâ informative: statistical techniques and inferential frameworksâ <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-harmsMakingNullEffects2018" role="doc-biblioref">Harms and Lakens</a> (<a href="#ref-harmsMakingNullEffects2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Psychologists must be able to test both for the presence of an effect and for the absence of an effect. In addition to testing against zero, researchers can use the two one-sided tests (TOST) procedure to test for equivalence and reject the presence of a smallest effect size of interest (SESOI). The TOST procedure can be used to determine if an observed effect is surprisingly small, given that a true effect at least as extreme as the SESOI exists. We explain a range of approaches to determine the SESOI in psychological science and provide detailed examples of how equivalence tests should be performed and reported. Equivalence tests are an important extension of the statistical tools psychologists currently use and enable researchers to falsify predictions about the presence, and declare the absence, of meaningful effects.

<h3 number="3.1.8"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.8</span> Multiple hypothesis testing (MHT)</h3>
<p>A typical conversation (unfold)</p>

<div class="fold">
<p>Namely that when we have multiple hypotheses testing in a paper how do we control for that and what do our p-values really mean. Particulary, there is <a href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/2/557/5195544">this paper</a> by Alwyn Young which (I think) is basically saying that when we have a load of hypotheses within a study and then one has a significant p value we are quite a lot of the time picking up a false result. Obviously that isnât very much of a surprise. But I think it also talks somewhat to the Steffano DellaVigna paper that was presented at the VAFE - that the publication bias really creeps in when we are publishing studies that have just one or two p values around 0.05. After all, it is those studies which have a real pay-off from getting that significant result.</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>From List et al (2019), discussing experiments reporting tests of multiple treatments, on multiple subgroups, and considering multiple outcomes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it is uncommon for the analyses of these data to account for the multiple hypothesis testing. As a result, the probability of a false rejection may be much higher than desired. To illustrate this point, consider testing <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> null hypotheses simultaneously. Suppose that for each null hypothesis a p value is available whose distribution is uniform on the unit interval when the corresponding null hypothesis is true. Suppose further that all null hypotheses are true and that the p values are independent. In this case, if we were to test each null hypothesis in the usual way at level <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in (0, 1)\)</span>, then the probability of one or more false rejections equals <span class="math inline">\(1 â (1 â \alpha)N\)</span>, which may be much greater than <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and in fact tends rapidly to one as <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> increases. For instance, with <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.05\)</span>, it equals <span class="math inline">\(0.226\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(N = 5\)</span> equals 0.401 when N = 10 and 0.994 when N = 100. In order to control the probability of a false rejection, it is therefore important to account appropriately for multiplicity of null hypotheses being tested.</p>

<p>Winston Linâs response to an email:</p>

<div class="fold">
<blockquote>
<p>On multiple comparisons corrections, there are some thorny philosophical issues and there isnât one right answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>mixed feelings about the recent popularity of multiplicity corrections in the social sciences. I think thereâs a tendency to fetishize p-values and null-hypothesis significance testing, and multiplicity-corrected p-values can be hard to interpret. (In principle, one could also report multiplicity-corrected confidence intervals, but I havenât seen people doing that.) To me, the real value of p-values and NHST (if there is any) is as a restraining device, and if this restraining device isnât working because of the multiple comparisons issue, thereâs more than one way to address the problem. In medical research, people often pre-specify one or two primary comparisons (which implies a commitment that these are the comparisons thatâll be highlighted in the abstract, and the rest are basically treated as exploratory) without doing multiplicity corrections.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, maybe you have to do multiplicity corrections because your reviewers want them, or maybe you donât have one or two primary comparisons between your 7 treatments. When I last followed the multiple comparisons literature (about 4 years ago), my feeling was that if I had to report multiplicity-corrected p-values, Iâd use either the Westfall-Young or the Romano-Wolf procedure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>our procedure (1) asymptotically controls the familywise error rateâthe probability of one or more false rejectionsâand (2) is asymptotically balanced in that the the marginal probability of rejecting any true null hypothesis is approximately equal in large samples. Importantly, by incorporating information about dependence ignored in classical multiple testing procedures, such as the Bonferroni (1935) and Holm (1979) corrections, our pro- cedure has much greater ability to detect truly false null hypotheses. In the presence of multiple treatments, we additionally show how to exploit logical restrictions across null hypotheses to further improve power.</p>

<p>Suppose we want to do a simple âdescriptive model of income.â Suppose we have three groups, North, Central, and South (think US regions).</p>
<p>Comparing otherwise similar groups, auppose average income in the North is 130, Central is 80, and South is 60. Suppose equal group sizes, so mean is 90</p>
<p>There should be a way, in a (linear regression) model, to report coefficients as differences from overall means (in a multivariate context, âall else equalâ) and get one for each
.
<span class="math inline">\(\beta_{North} = 40\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\beta_{Central} = -10\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\(\beta_{South} = -30\)</span></p>
<p>And skip the intercept, obviously.</p>
<p>This seems most intuitive to me. But I canât for the life of me figure out how to get this with Râs âcontrast coding.â (And also, that seems to mess up the variable names).</p>

<p>Now this seems to get us the adjustment coefficients we are looking for, but</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The names of the regions are lost; how do I know which is which?</li>
<li>It is apparently reporting the adjustment coefficients for s (south) and c (central). Not very intuitive.</li>

<p>This seems to be the case no matter how we relevel the region to set a particular base group (I tried it) â¦ the coefficients donât change.</p>

<p>Yay! This is what I wanted, and miraculously the variable names are preserved. But it seems a weird way to do it. Also note that, with the above code, this set of coefficients appears no matter which contrast matrix I force, whether sum or treatment.</p>
<p>However, this does not carry over easily to multiple dimensions of contrast coding (illustrate).</p>

<h2 number="4.1"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> (How) can diagnostic tests make sense? Where is the burden of proof?</h2>
<p>Where a particular assumption is critical to identification and inference â¦ iFailure to reject the violation of an assumption is not sufficient to give us confidence that it is satisfied and the results are credible. Authors frequently cite insignificant statistical tests as evidence in support of a substantive model, or of evidence that they do not need to worry about certain confounds. Although the problem of induction is difficult, I find this approach inadequate. Where a negative finding is given as an important result, the authors should also show that their parameter estimate is tightly bounded around zero. Where it is cited as evidence they can ignore a confound, they should provide evidence that they can statistically bound that effect is small enough that it should not reasonably cause an issue (e.g., as using Lee or McNemar bounds for selective attrition/hurdles).</p>
<p>I am concerned with the interpretation of diagnostic testing, both in model selection, and in the defense of the exclusion restrictions or identification assumptions. It is problematic, when the basic consistency of the estimator (or a main finding of the paper) critically depends on such tests failing to reject a null hypothesis, to merely state that the âtest failed to reject, therefore we maintain the null hypothesis.â</p>

<h3 number="4.1.1"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Further discussion: the DiD approach and âparallel trendsâ</h3>
<p>BB 17/06:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[In general] economists do â¦ suggest that they have evidence which allows them to accept null hypotheses. The motivating example would be in the case of DiD estimation, where we have to assume parallel trends. My hunch is that fairly frequently people just say âyes we have evidence the trends were parallel pre-interventionâ and then point away to something that shows a <span class="math inline">\(p&gt;0.05\)</span> on pre-interenvetion differences in trend. Sometimes this is done better where they say âyeah here is a (relatively) tightly estimated zero effect.â But what do we accept as good enough to show that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Building on that point, it seems that we do need something to tell us when DiD is valid and yet donât yet have something. My hunch is that the answer may well lie in Bayesian approaches. DRâs suggestion was, I think, that we could maybe simultaneously try and estimate the difference in trends both before and after intervention simultaneously.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DR: My idea was that a Bayesian approach would have involve a parameter for âdifferential trend,â with a prior (and then posterior) distribution over both this parameter and the ultimate estimate. Iâll look to find comparable approaches in the literature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BB: I was wondering about a less sophisticated approach in which we set up the prior to be not-parallel trends and see over what range of ânot parallelâ priors the posterior is pulled closer to the idea of there actually being a parallel trend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DR: Itâs an interesting reframe, to place the burden of proof on the researcher; sort of ârejecting the null of a non-parallel trend.â But how can this work? And how to deal with the idea that the null could be a differential trend <em>in either direction</em>?</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>@BB: And perhaps we should try to have this discussion using the specific equations and assumptions of DiD?</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>BB: I think similar to what DR suggested above is what we used in the Bayesian approaches to do for Covid. Seems to me that the intervention in this case is the lockdown. There we assume that when a country locks down it reduces the R, and we estimate two different Rs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DR: Can you define this with a few equations to fix ideas? Itâs hard to follow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BB: Thinking about that approach here, we could try and estimate a pre-intervention relationship between the two groups, and then introduce a post-intervention term which is asked to explain the residual of the variation in the intervention group post-treatment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>BB: Again, I think they key would be trying to establish âover what prior assumptions for the pre-treatment trend is the posterior outcome for post-treatment effect in a particular direction.â</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DR: Yes, essentially, we need to consider the sensitivity of the estimates to the assumption!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I think before we get into this we should definitely look at the tweet on DiD that you included as well as the drive folder of Patrick Button</p>

<p>Essentially a âcontrol strategyâ is âcontrol for all or most of the
reasonable determinants of the independent variable so as to make the
remaining unobservable component very small, minimizing the potential
for bias in the coefficient of interest.â All of the controls must still
be exogenous, otherwise this itself can lead to a bias. There is some
discussion of how to validate this approach; see, e.g.,

(statistical learning): Lasso, Ridge, and more</p>
<p>Machine learning seeks to fit models to data in order to <em>learn</em>
patterns and thus make predictions about the future. This learning is
split into categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Supervised learning</strong>: Here our data consists of <em>labelled</em>
examples. This means that we have data on the outcome variable of
interest. Linear regression is a form of supervised learning
algorithm as the data used will contain values for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and is thus
labeled.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unsupervised learning</strong>: In this type of learning data has no
label. Clustering algorithms are examples of unsupervised learning,
where the model seeks to group objects into collections with other
similar observations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Semi-supervised learning</strong>: This method is used in order to
account for the high cost of labeling data. Where a data set may
have labels for some observations and not for others we use
semi-supervised learning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong>: Reinforcement learning works by
assigning rewards (or errors) to actions taken by an algorithm.
Typically this reward will be an estimate of how much reward is
received at the end of a <em>round</em>. This method is popular in
artificial intelligence programs, such as the AlphaGo algorithm by
DeepMind. <!-- Add example for economics --></p></li>

<p>From a discussion on the EA forum about predicting donation choices</p>
<blockquote>
<p>â¦ the ML approaches Greg is suggesting here are all about
<strong>prediction</strong>, not about drawing meaningful inferences.For prediction
itâs good to start with the largest amount of features (variables) you
can find (as long as they are truly ex-ante) and then do a fancy dance
of cross-validation and regularisation, before you do your final
âvalidationâ of the model on set-aside data.But that doesnât easily
give you the ability to make strong inferential statements (causal or
not), about things like âage is likely to be strongly associated with
satisfaction measures in the true population.â Why not? If I
understand correctly:<em>The model you end up with, which does a great
job at predicting your outcome</em><br />
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>â¦ may have dropped <code>age</code> entirely or âregularized itâ in a way
that does not yield an unbiased or consistent estimator of the
actual impact of <code>age</code>Â  on your outcome. Remember, the goal here
was prediction, not making inferences about the relationship
between of any particular variable or sets of variables â¦</p></li>
<li><p>â¦ may include too many variables that are highly correlated with
the <code>age</code>Â  variable, thus making the age coefficient very
imprecise</p></li>
<li><p>â¦Â  may include variables that are actually âpart of the age
effect you cared about, because they are things that go naturally
with age, such as mental agilityâ</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the standard âstatistical inferenceâ (how you can
quantify your uncertainty) does not work for these learning models
(although there are new techniques being developed)</p></li>

<div class="marginnote">
<p>This section was mainly written by Oska Fentem.</p>
</div>
<p>Decision trees are a type of supervised machine learning algorithm.
While they are very simple and intuitive to understand, they form the
basis for a variety of more complex models. Here we will discuss the
model in the context of a classification problem; however they can also
be used for continuous outcome (âregressionâ) settings.</p>
<p>Decision trees are a type of supervised machine learning algorithm.
âRecursive binarry splittingâ is used; the algorithm repeatedly splits
the data into subsets and subsets of these subsets, finally making a
prediction based on the dominant group in each subset.
<!-- Guess who example --> A decision tree consists of:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Root node</strong>: this is the first node in the tree.</li>
<li><strong>Interior nodes</strong>: these are the nodes on which the data is split.</li>
<li><strong>Leaf nodes</strong>: these contain the final classifications made by the
model.</li>
</ol>
<p>In splitting a data set by itâs features (variables) the decision tree
algorithm seeks to split using the most informative features first. In
order to calculate which features are the most informative we can
calculate <strong>information gain</strong> or <strong>Gini impurity</strong>.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<div id="information-gain" class="section level4" number="5.1.2.1">
<h4 number="5.1.2.1"><span class="header-section-number">5.1.2.1</span> Information Gain</h4>
<p>Information gain is used to measure the feature which provides the
largest increase in information about the classification of our outcome
variable. This metric is based on the notion of entropy, a measure of
set impurity as well as the remaining information.</p>
<p><strong>Entropy</strong>: For <span class="math inline">\(X = x_1,â¦, x_n\)</span> occurring with probability
<span class="math inline">\(P(x_1),â¦, P(x_n)\)</span> entropy is defined as:
<span class="math display">\[\text{Entropy} = -\sum_{i=1}^n P(x_i)\log_2 P(x_i)\]</span> Entropy is high
when there is more uncertainty around the result if we were to guess a
member of the set at random. An example of a set with high entropy would
be a pack of playing cards. Each card in the set has a low probability
of being picked. This means that we would be very uncertain about the
outcome of picking a card at random. By graphing the function
<span class="math inline">\(- P(x_i) \log_2 P(x_i)\)</span> we see that as the probability of an each
outcome decreases the total entropy increases:</p>
<p><img src="metrics_and_tools_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Using the entropy function we are able to compute information gain with
the following three equations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}&amp;\operatorname{rem}(d, \mathcal{D})=\sum_{I \in \text {levels}(d)} \underbrace{\frac{\left|\mathcal{D}_{d=I}\right|}{|\mathcal{D}|}}_{\text {weighting }} \times \underbrace{H\left(t, \mathcal{D}_{d=I}\right)}_{\text {entropy of partition} \space \mathcal{D}_{d=I}}\\&amp;I G(d, \mathcal{D})=H(t, \mathcal{D})-\operatorname{rem}(d, \mathcal{D})\end{aligned}

<div id="ensemble-learning" class="section level4" number="5.1.2.2">
<h4 number="5.1.2.2"><span class="header-section-number">5.1.2.2</span> Ensemble learning</h4>
<p>Decision trees provide an easy and intuitive way to represent a complex
relationships between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. While these models have very low bias
they have high variance. This means that changes in the training data
may cause large changes in the predictions made by the model.</p>
<p><strong>Random forests</strong> are a form of ensemble learning. This method works by
combining multiple weaker classifiers into one strong one. By doing this
we average the predictions made across all the decision trees, which can
often result in better performance than a single tree. In a random
forest we fit multiple decision tree models on random bootstrap
sub-samples of our data, limiting ourselves, in each forest, to a
randomly-restricted subset of variables (features). The algorithm works
as follows:</p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(b=1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Draw a bootstrap sample <span class="math inline">\(Z^*\)</span> of size <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> from our training data</p>
<ul>
<li>Select a subset of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> variables by random out of a total of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
variables</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Use this sample to fit a tree, <span class="math inline">\(T_b\)</span>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p>Pick the best variable to split the data on out of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Split the node</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Steps i-ii are repeated until the minimum node size is reached.</p></li>
<li><p>Output ensemble</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Note that this procedure is similar to bagging. However, by using a
random set of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> variables to consider for splitting our nodes the
random forest algorithm achieves lower correlation between the
individual trees. Standard bagging instead makes use of all <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
variables when deciding on tree splits, which could result in trees that
are correlated. If we have a collection of identically distributed trees
then the expectation of all these models is equal to the expectation of
any one of them. If one tree is more likely to make a wrong prediction
this is averaged out by the lack of correlation between this and the
other models.</p>
<p>As forests contain a collection of smaller trees the prediction process
is slightly different than for individual trees. Consider that each tree
gives a prediction <span class="math inline">\(\hat{C}_b(X)\)</span>. Our random forest prediction is thus:
<span class="math display">\[\hat{C}_{rf}^B = \text{Majority vote} \{ \hat{C}_n)x_i \}^B_1\]</span></p>

<p>The answer to this question: while the impact of changing each

there is <em>also</em> an impact of changing one coefficient on the <em>other</em>
derivatives. As one coefficient shrinks to zero the marginal impact of
the other coefficients on the SSR may (will?) increase.</p>

<p><strong>Relaxed lasso</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>the least-squares fit on the subset of the three predictors tends to
expand the lasso estimates away from zero. The nonzero estimates from
the lasso tend to be biased toward zero, so the debiasing in the right
panel can often improve the prediction error of the model. This

<p>So how does machine learning manage to do out-of-sample prediction? The
first part of the solution is regularization. In the tree case, instead
of choosing the -best" overall tree, we could choose the best tree among
those of a certain depth.</p>
<p>(p5) Tree depth is an example of a regularizer. It measures the
complexity of a function. As we regularize less, we do a better job at
approximating the in-sample variation, but for the same reason, the
wedge between in-sample and out-of-sample</p>
<p>(p6) how do we choose the level of regularization (-tune the
algorithm")? This is the second key insight: empirical tuning.</p>
<p>(p6) -tuning within the training sample In empirical tuning, we create
an out-of-sample experiment inside the original sample. We fit on one
part of the data and ask which level of regularization leads to the best
performance on the other part of the data.4 We can increase the
efficiency of this procedure through cross-validation: we randomly
partition the sample into equally sized subsamples (-folds"). The
estimation process then involves successively holding out one of the
folds for evaluation while fitting the prediction function for a range
of regularization parameters on all remaining folds. Finally, we pick
the parameter with the best estimated average performance.5 The</p>
<p>(p6) -! This procedure works because prediction quality is observable:
both predictions y- and outcomes y are observed. Contrast this with
parameter estimation, where typically we must rely on assumptions about
the data-generating process to ensure consistency</p>

<p>(p6) -but can we make inferences about the structure? hypothesis
testing? Regularization combines with the observability of prediction
quality to allow us to fit flexible functional forms and still find
generalizable structure.</p>
<p>(p7) Picking the prediction function then involves two steps: The first
step is, conditional on a level of complexity, to pick the best
in-sample loss-minimizing function.8 The second step is to estimate the
optimal level of complexity using empirical tuning (as we saw in
cross-validating the depth of the tree).</p>
<p>(p8) -but they forgot to mention that others are shrunk linear
regression in which only a small number of predictors from all possible
variables are chosen to have nonzero values: the absolute-value
regularizer encourages a coefficient vector where many are exactly zero.</p>
<p>(p4) -why no ridge or elastic net? LASSO</p>
<p>(p8) -ensembles usually win contests While it may be unsurprising that
such ensembles perform well on average- after all, they can cover a
wider array of functional forms-it may be more surprising that they come
on top in virtually every prediction competition</p>
<p>(p8) -neural nets broadly explained neural nets are popular prediction
algorithms for image recognition tasks. For one standard implementation
in binary prediction, the underlying function class is that of nested
logistic regressions: The final prediction is a logistic transformation
of a linear combination of variables (-neurons") that are themselves
such logistic transformations, creating a layered hierarchy of logit
regressions. The complexity of these functions is controlled by the
number of layers, the number of neurons per layer, and their
connectivity (that is, how many variables from one level enter each
logistic regression on the next)</p>
<p>(p9) These choices about how to represent the features will interact
with the regularizer and function class: A linear model can reproduce
the log base area per room from log base area and log room number
easily, while a regression tree would require many splits to do so.</p>
<p>(p9) In a traditional estimator, replacing one set of variables by a set
of transformed variables from which it could be reconstructed would not
change the predictions, because the set of functions being chosen from
has not changed. But with regularization, including these variables can
improve predictions because-at any given level of regularization-the set
of functions might change</p>
<p>(p9) -!! Economic theory and content expertise play a crucial role in
guiding where the algorithm looks for structure first. This is the sense
in which -simply throw it all in- is an unreasonable way to understand
or run these machine learning algorithms</p>
<p>(p9) -I need hear of using adjusted r square for this Should
out-ofsample performance be estimated using some known correction for
overfitting (such as an adjusted R2 when it is available) or using
cross-validation</p>
<p>(p9) -big unknowns available finite-sample guidance on its
implementation-such as heuristics for the number of folds (usually five
to ten) or the -one standard-error rule" for tuning the LASSO (Hastie,
Tibshirani, and Friedman 2009)-has a more ad-hoc flavor</p>
<p>(p9) firewall principle: none of the data involved in fitting the
prediction function-which includes crossvalidation to tune the
algorithmâis used to evaluate the prediction function that is produced</p>
<p>(p10) -how? First, econometrics can guide design choices, such as the
number of folds or the function class</p>
<p>(p10) with the fitted function. Why not also use it to learn something
about the -underlying model</p>
<p>(p10) -!! the lack of standard errors on the coefficients. Even when
machine-learning predictors produce familiar output like linear
functions, forming these standard errors can be more complicated than
seems at first glance as they would have to account for the model
selection itself. In fact, Leeb and P-tscher (2006, 2008) develop
conditions under which it is impossible to obtain (uniformly) consistent
estimates of the distribution of model parameters after data-driven
selection</p>
<p>(p11) -lasso chosen variables are unstable because of multicollinearity.
a problem for making inferences from estimated coefficients the
variables are correlated with each other (say the number of rooms of a
house and its square-footage), then such variables are substitutes in
predicting house prices. Similar predictions can be produced using very
different variables. Which variables are actually chosen depends on the
specific finite sample</p>
<p>(p11) this creates an Achilles- heel: more functions mean a greater
chance that two functions with very different</p>
<p>(p12) coefficients can produce similar prediction quality</p>
<p>(p12) In econometric terms, while the lack of standard errors
illustrates the limitations to making inference after model selection,
the challenge here is (uniform) model selection consistency itself</p>
<p>(p12) -is this equally a problem for non sparsity based procedures like
ridge? First, it encourages the choice of less complex, but wrong
models. Even if the best model uses interactions of number of bathrooms
with number of rooms, regularization may lead to a choice of a simpler
(but worse) model that uses only number of fireplaces. Second, it can
bring with it a cousin of omitted variable bias, where we are typically
concerned with correlations between observed variables and unobserved
ones. Here, when regularization excludes some variables, even a
correlation between observed variables and other observed (but excluded)
ones can create bias in the estimated coefficients</p>
<p>(p12) Some econometric results also show the converse: when there is
structure, it will be recovered at least asymptotically (for example,
for prediction consistency of LASSO-type estimators in an approximately
sparse linear framework, see Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Hansen 2011).</p>
<p>(p12) -unrealistic for micro economic applications Zhao and Yu (2006)
who establish asymptotic model-selection consistency for the LASSO.
Besides assuming that the true model is -sparseââonly a few variables
are relevant-they also require theâirrepresentable condition" between
observables: loosely put, none of the irrelevant covariates can be even
moderately related to the set of relevant ones. In practice, these
assumptions are strong.</p>
<p>(p13) Machine learning can deal with unconventional data that is too
high-dimensional for standard estimation methods, including image and
language information that we conventionally had not even thought of as
data we can work with, let alone include in a regression</p>
<p>(p13) satellite data</p>
<p>(p13) they provide us with a large x vector of image-based data; these
images are then matched (in what we hope is a representative sample) to
yield data which form the y variable. This translation of satellite
images to yield measures is a prediction problem</p>
<p>(p13) particularly relevant where reliable data on economic outcomes are
missing, such as in tracking and targeting poverty in developing
countries (Blumenstock 2016</p>

<p>(p14) Prediction in the Service of Estimation</p>
<p>(p14) linear instrumental variables understood as a two-stage procedure</p>
<p>(p14) The first stage is typically handled as an estimation step. But
this is effectively a prediction task: only the predictions x- enter the
second stage; the coefficients in the first stage are merely a means to
these fitted values. Understood this way, the finite-sample biases in
instrumental variables are a consequence of overfitting</p>
<p>(p14) -ll overfitting. Overfitting means that the in-sample fitted
values x- pick up not only the signal -â²z, but also the noise Î´. As a
consequence, xË is biased towards x, and the second-stage instrumental
variable estimate - - is thus biased towards the ordinary least squares
estimate of y on x. Since overfit will be larger when sample size is
low, the number of instruments is high, or the instruments are weak, we
can see why biases arise in these cases</p>
<p>(p14) same techniques applied here result in split-sample instrumental
variables (Angrist and Krueger 1995) and -jackknife" instrumental
variables (Angrist, Imbens, and Krueger 1999)</p>
<p>(p15) -worth referencing In particular, a set of papers has already
introduced regularization into the first stage in a high-dimensional
setting, including the LASSO (Belloni, Chen, Chernozhukov, and Hansen
2012) and ridge regression (Carrasco 2012; Hansen and Kozbur 2014). More
recent extensions include nonlinear functional forms, all the way to
neural nets (Hartford, Leyton-Brown, and Taddy 2016</p>
<p>(p15) Practically, even when there appears to be only a few instruments,
the problem is effectively high-dimensional because there are many
degrees of freedom in how instruments are actually constructed</p>
<p>(p15) -a note of caution It allows us to let the data explicitly pick
effective specifications, and thus allows us to recover more of the
variation and construct stronger instruments, provided that predictions
are constructed and used in a way that preserves the exclusion
restriction</p>
<p>(p15) -this seems similar to my idea of regularising on a subset
Chernozhukov, Chetverikov, Demirer, Duflo, Hansen, and Newey (2016) take
care of high-dimensional controls in treatment effect estimation by
solving two simultaneous prediction problems, one in the outcome and one
in the treatment equation</p>

effects on many outcomes. Both can be viewed as prediction problems
(Ludwig, Mullainathan, and Spiess 2017). If treatment assignment can be
predicted better than chance from pretreatment covariates, this is a
sign of imbalance. If treatment assignment can be predicted from a set
of outcomes, the treatment must have had an effect</p>

heterogeneity heterogenous treatment effects can be used to assign
treatments; Misra and Dub- (2016) illustrate this on the problem of

<p>(p16) -caveat Suppose the algorithm chooses a tree that splits on
education but not on age. Conditional on this tree, the estimated
coefficients are consistent. But that does not imply that treatment
effects do not also vary by age, as education may well covary with age;
on other draws of the data, in fact, the same procedure could have
chosen a tree that split on age instead</p>

The general point being that IV seems to have more publication bias than the other approaches to causal inference. Not sure that is that much of a surprise. In my chat with one of the authors he pointed out that in IV any changes are less obvious - in DiD (which doesnt perform great either)/RD the assumptions are much clearer to visualise on a graph. I also think that - in kind of a related way - there are many more places where there is [researcher] discretion in the IV approach.</p>

<div class="marginnote">
<p>BB: Whereas in DiD (which doesnât perform great either)/RD the its really easy to just graph the basic data and you can kind of eyeball that to see if there is any effect and if the assumptions are met (I actually think this kind of speaks somewhat for the need to really be able to test the assumptions at the heart of DiD and RD - itâs so hard to provide a valid statistical test that just the fact we can eye-ball test the assumptions is useful).

<p>BB:</p>
<p>From that Twitter thread i also found this really useful <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14VgSFPsmv2H8ZngW-P2xEQE7g4WbWXfH">google drive folder</a> of recent developments.</p>
<p>This Freyaldenhoven <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20180609">paper</a> might also be handy. And it looks like there is quite a lot by Susan Athey that we should look at too.</p>
<p>Re Athey, she has a paper with Imbens (2006) which proposes the change in changes approach which allows estimation of hetergoenous treatment effects in a âbetterâ way than quantile DiD. The assumptions of CiC are pretty similar to those of DiD.</p>
<p>That method (CiC) is applied by <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w25636">this Assuncao paper</a> to the Amazon. We actually looked at this paper at the journal club in LEEP and the point was raised that actually you could see the observed effect (reduced deforestation in targetted municipalities) simply owing to the fact there is very little other forest left to harvest.</p>
<p>On DiD more generally, I think it suffers from the flaw that we have to somehow establish pre-treatment parallel trends which is basically an issue of âaccepting a null hypothesisâ which is clearly not possible with traditional statistical inference.</p>
<p>DR: Yes, the problem of <a href="#robust-diag">diagnostic testing</a> the assumption that the identification entirely relies on. Does CiC suffer from the same issue?</p>

<p>From <a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/population-health-methods/age-period-cohort-analysis">Columbia Public health</a>, in the context of epidemiology:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Age effects</strong> are variations linked to biological and social processes of aging specific to individuals â¦ unrelated to the time period or birth cohort to which an individual belongs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We might want to further disentangle this (at least conceptually) into:</p>

<div class="fold">
<ul>
<li><p>overall-age effects: effect of an individual, organization, or any âunitâsâ age in years <em>vs</em></p></li>
<li><p>âtenure effectsâ: the effect of time spent participating (e.g., time in the labor force or as part of a political movement)</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Period effects</strong> result from external factors that equally affect all age groups at a particular calendar time. â¦ [e.g.] environmental, social and economic factors, e.g.Â war, famine, economic crisis.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Cohort effects</strong> are variations resulting from the unique experience/exposure of a group of subjects (cohort) as they move across time. The most commonly defined group in epidemiology is the birth cohort based on year of birth and it is described as difference in the risk of a health outcome based on birth year.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>âidentification problemâ in APCâ¦ s due to the exact linear dependency among age, period, and cohort: Period â Age = Cohort; that is, given the calendar year and age, one can determine the cohort (birth year)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/economics/Papers/2014/nielsen_apc_package.pdf">This apc package writeup looks promising both as a tool and an explanation</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A standard APC model of the age-period-specific statistic (e.g., the average income) for age group <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in period <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>: (OâBrien et al, 2008)</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Y_{ij} = \mu  + \alpha_i + \pi_j + \chi_k + \epsilon_{ij} \]</span>
They refer to the âeffect of the ith age groupâ <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_i\)</span> but this need not be interpreted causally.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\pi_j\)</span> captures period <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\chi_k\)</span> the kth cohort <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> the intercept, and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ij}\)</span> the
ârandom disturbance.â</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The] linear dependency among the variables representing age, period, and cohort, since knowing the values of any two of these variables allows one to know the value of the third â¦ means that we cannot estimate the A â 1 age effects, the P â 1 period effects, and the A + P â 1 cohort effects in a single OLS model.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I believe) this holds whether or not we restrict the age, period, or cohort effects to being linear in a time variable.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The above equation also depicts the âageâperiodâcohort-characteristic (APCC)â model, letting <span class="math inline">\(\chi_k\)</span> represent âthe value of [here, a single] cohort characteristic for the kth cohort.â
In other words, we replace a set of simple cohort dummies with (I presume) a variable meant to capture the meaningful characteristic of the cohort leading to the aforementioned âcohort effects.â</p>
<p>" This formulation eliminates the linear dependency â¦ since the cohortsâ values on the cohort characteristic are unlikely to be perfectly linearly related to the age and period."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>They next depict an âage-periodâ model:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Y_{ij} = \mu + \alpha_i + \pi_j + \epsilon_{ij}\]</span></p>
<p>Estimating this model leads to the âobserved residualsâ <span class="math inline">\(e_{ij}\)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We could then examine the pattern of these residuals to see if they indicate an effect of cohort membership (after controlling for the effects of age and period).</p>

<p>intermediate outcome <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> (e.g., completion of degree in first-choice course and institution),</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>âasked to donate in the first roundâ (in Reinstein, Riener and Vance-McMullen, henceforth âRRVâ experiments, and perhaps in Schmitz 2019)â,</p></li>
<li><p>a greater incentive or a nudge to donate in round 1 (Heger and Slonim, 2020; others?),</p></li>
<li><p>the inclusion of (an incentive to donate to) an additional charity in that same round (Reinstein 2006; Filiz-Ozbay and Uler; many others),</p></li>
</ol>
<p>the intermediate outcome <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the amount given to that (first-round) charity,</p>
<p>and the final outcome <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is the amount given to that charity (or other charities) in round 2 (experiments â3â: other charities in that round ).</p>
</div>
<p>The treatment <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> (may) directly affect the final outcome <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Do: show a diagram here</p>
</div>
<p><span class="math display">\[T\rightarrow Y\]</span></p>

<p>The intermediate outcome also may affect the final outcome <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[M \rightarrow Y\]</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>With exogenous variation in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> <em>and</em> <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> (or identified instruments for each of these), we should be able to estimate each of these three relationships as functions.</p>
<p>With homogeneous (and in a simplest case linear and separate) effects we can then use these functions to compute the total (direct plus indirect) effect of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p>
<p>We could also compute the share of this effect that occurs <em>via</em> the intermediate effect, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(T \rightarrow M\rightarrow Y\)</span>.
This should be merely the composition of these two functions, or, in the linear case, the product of the slope coefficients.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, there are two major challenges to this estimation.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>We (may) have a valid instrument for (exogenous variation in) <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> only, and <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> may arise through a process involving selection on unobserved variables.</p></li>
<li><p>Each of the three above relationships (as well as the selection equation) may involve heterogeneous functions; i.e., differential treatment effects.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Thus we consult the relevant literature, discussed below.</p>
<p>The most influential paper in Economics has been <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Heckman2013" role="doc-biblioref">Heckman, Pinto, and Heckman 2013</a>)</span>.</p>

<div class="fold">
<p>â¦ We follow Heckman et al.Â (2013) and Heckman and Pinto (2015) in using mediation analysis.

than changes in the measured mediators (including changes in mediators that are not observed by the analyst and changes in the mapping between mediators and outcomes).</p>

<p>In Leeâs paper, the estimate seems to give very narrow and informative bounds even though they have a great many people who do not earn any wages as a share of the population, about 54%. These are much narrower than the bounds proposed by Horowitz and M then what those bounds produce.</p>

<p>âthe problem of nonrandom sample selection is well-understood in the training literature; â¦ may be one of the reasons why most evaluations of job-training programs focus on total earnings, including zeros for those without a job, rather than on wages conditional on employmentâ âof the 24 studies referenced in a survey â¦ (Heckman et al.)â¦ Most examine annual, quarterly, or monthly earnings without discussing the sample selection problem examining rage rates.â</p>
</blockquote>
<p>â <em>DR:</em> (@NL)Note that this is relevant to our question of whether to exclude zeros in log models, etc. While there will be less unemployment in our data, it still may be a relevant influence made have a strong effect on the estimates.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>â¦previous conventional approaches to the sample selection problem (skip if desired).</strong> One may explicitly model the process determining selection, such as in Heckman (1979) â¦</p>
<p>Separate equations for the wage and the propensity to be employed, where employment occurs if the latter crosses a particular threshold, in which case a wage is observed. It is reasonable to think that the treatment variable can have effects on both terms..</p>
<p>âsample selection bias can be seen as specification error in the conditional expectationâ¦â</p>
<p>The expected wage conditional on treatment exogenous variables and the selection into working (that is the underlying propensity to work variable exceeding zero) his status is equal to the true effect of the treatment an adjustment for the differences in the observableâs exogenous variables and a bias term representing the expectation of the idiosyncratic unobservables given the treatment and the exogenous variables exceeding the value necessary to induce work participation. The unobservable term needs to exceed the prediction based on the observable term for the entire term to exceed zero inducing labor force participation.</p>
<p>One may assume the data are missing at random, perhaps conditional on a set of covariates (Rubin, 1976; essentially assuming the error terms in each equation are independent of one another, here âemployment status is unrelated to the determination of wagesââ¦ This âis strictly inconsistent with standard models of labor supply that account for the participation decision (Heckman, 1974).â</p>
<p>A more common assumption is that some exogenous variables âdetermine sample selection but do not have their own direct impact on the outcome of interestâ¦. Exclusion restrictions are used in parametric and semi-parametric modelsâ¦â</p>
<p>but âthere may not exist credible âinstrumentsâ¦ excluded from the outcome equationâ</p>
<hr />
<p>â <em>DR, aside:</em> We can return to (our) previous papers to impose these Lee bounds! One example would be the Siskel and Ebert your reviews paper and perhaps incorporating us with subsequent approaches, considering the âselection to reviewâ equation.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Second approach âthe construction of worst-case scenario bounds of the treatment effectâ</strong></p>
<p>âImpute missing data with either the largest or smallest possible values to compute the largest and smallest possible treatment effects consistent with the dataâ as in Horwitz and Manski (2000a) who provide a general framework for this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Particularly useful with binary outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This cannot be used when the support is unbounded. â¦ note in their replication example they are actually using the equivalent of the bottom 5th percentile and the top 95th percentile. Strictly using a procedure would provide even wider bounds.</p>
<p>Lee considers his approach to be a hybrid of the two previous general approaches.</p>
<p>â¦end of section 2.. .a statement of the Horwitz upper bound for the treatment effect; very intuitive: âwhat if everyone in the treatment who dropped out would have had the largest possible wage and everyone in the control group that drop out wouldâve had the smallest possible wage; this will give the upper bound.â Switching this the other way around will give a lower bound.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>DR, an aside thought:</em> (@NL) Something akin to the Horwitz and M approach (or maybe Lee bounds) could be applied to our issue of swapping into institutions directly. Suppose we only focus on those who <em>actually</em> complied: those assigned to an institution who also went to that institution. Our concern was that this would under-represent those who had particularly strong institutional preferences. Suppose you are interested in looking at the impact of winning the lottery (for once preferred institution) itself, as that was our most simply identifiable outcome.</p>
<p>â¦ Letâs consider evaluating a treatment effect for those who happened to swap in. Those who swapped in might be assigned a counter-factual outcome of the lowest value of the lifetime income among those who did not get their institution of choice. Similarly, the small group who swapped out might be assigned a counterfactual outcome (had they no swapped out) representing the highest outcome value for those who did get their institution of choice. This should give us an upper bound on the treatment effect for these two groups of what we might call non-compliers. Making the opposite assumptions, precisely that those who swapped <em>into</em> their institution of choice wouldâve had a very good counterfactual outcome (if they had not got their institution of choice) that comes from the highest outcomes for those who didnât get their institution of choice (and also reversing this for those who swapped out of their preferred institution) would give us a lower bound for the treatment effect for this group. We can then combine these bounded treatment effects for these non-compliers with the treatment effect for the compliers to get a measure of the average treatment effect with bounds for this sort of behavior.</p>
<p>This will also allow us to come up with estimates with bounds <em>without</em> having to use the instrumental variable strategy which has issues of its own.</p>

<p>He starts with a simple example. He begins with a model with a treatment indicator and no other covariates, and a continuous outcome variable, but notes that this will clearly apply to discrete outcome variables and will also apply conditional on controls.</p>
<p>Nest, he brings forward the statementâ¦ from the earlier selection models. In each case the latent variable must overcome a hurdle for the outcome to be observed and in fact <em>the hurdle differs depending on the impact of the treatment itself</em>. In general <em>when the errors in the selection and outcome equations are correlated the difference in these means differs from the actual treatment effect</em>. In other words through a slightly complicated story, when those who have unobservables that make them more likely to work also tend to have unobservables that would make them likely to earn more the standard difference in outcomes between control and treatment will <em>not</em> describe the true treatment effect.</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p><em>A key insight</em> seems to be that we could identify the treatment effect if we could estimate the expected outcome given treatment <em>and</em> given that the unobservable component in the selection equation would lead to an observable outcome had the person <em>not</em> been given treatment. If so, we could subtract the observed mean control outcome from the above to yield the true treatment effect (for those who would be observed always). However, we obviously do not observe this because we only observe the outcomes for those who are treated where the selection equation <em>is</em> in fact positive and not âwhere the selection equation <em>would have</em> been positive had they not been treated.â</p>
<p>However, the insight here is that this term can in fact be bounded. We <em>do</em> observe these outcomes for the treated people (note we are assuming without loss of generality that the treatment raises the probability of selection for this discussion) but we donât know exactly which ones they are. In other words, we observe outcomes for more people in the treatment group than we need; we wish we could figure out what is the subset of these that would have <em>also</em> been observed had they not been treated, so we could compare like-to-like. The observed treatment mean is a weighted average of the thing we are seeking (to difference from the control) and âthe mean for a subpopulation of marginal individualsâ¦ that are induced to be selected into the sample <em>because</em> of the treatmentâ</p>
<p>This then gets us the upper bound for the term expressing the treatment outcome for those who would have been observed even if they had been in the control. The upper bound for this is the expected outcome for those in the treated group (who are observed of course) and who are in quantile-p or above of the outcome, where this <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is the share of the treated population that are in the marginal group we referred to that were only induced to be selected into the sample because of the treatment.</p>
<p>In other words the worst case scenario is that the smallest share <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> values of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> are in the marginal group and the largest one (which is share 1-pone are in the inframarginal group. We donât know which observations are inframarginal and which ones are marginal.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>: the share of marginal individuals and (1-p) the share of inframarginal individuals (the latter is group we want the average outcome for). The highest could be would be the average outcomefor the largest (1-p) share of this group. We are looking for the expectation given that they are at or above at will at or above percentile p within this group.</p>
<p>In other words we trim the lower tail of the Y distribution by the portion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, (so what remains is the 1-p share) to get the upper bound for the inframarginal groups mean. We can then subtract the mean for the control group to get an upper bound for the treatment effect.</p>
<p>To compute this âtrimming proportion pâ: this p is equal to the share of the treated group whose outcome is observed minus the share of the control group whose outcome is deserved is observed, divided by the share of the treatment group where the outcome is observed.
Something like the <em>increased likelihood of observation that is driven by the treatment, as a share of the total number as a share of the probability of observation in the treatment group</em>.</p>
<p>The average observed outcome for the treatment group is including too many observations; we need to difference out the share of observations that are observed only because the treatment caused them to be observed; this share is certainly no larger than the increased probability of observation in the treatment group as a share of the probability of observations the treatment group.</p>
<p>Another much simpler way of saying this is âtrimming the data by the known proportion of excess individualsâ in the treatment group. (To gain bounds on the mean for the inframarginal group which we can then difference from the control-group mean get the treatment effect).</p>
<p>Perhaps some intuition for why this improves on the Horwitz model: we donât need to assume that those observed in the treatment group that wouldnât have been observed in the control wouldâve had the highest possible outcomes. No, we only need to assume (to get the upper bound) that these came from the highest <em>distribution</em> because they had to come from somewhere. These were the people in the upper tail of the relevant group but they couldnât <em>all</em> have been the individual highest achiever.</p>
<hr />
<p>The model is extended to heterogeneity and heteroscedasticity. This begins with the independence of treatment assignment the âpotential sample selection indicatorsâ for either treatment or control, in other words whether that individual will have an observed outcome under treatment and whether that the individual would have an observed outcome under control, and the latent potential outcomes.</p>
<p>Experimental or random assignment ensures that each of the potential outcomes (and the correspondence to observability under each treatment) is independent of the actual assigned treatment.</p>
<p>The second assumption is monotonicity: treatment assignment can only affect sample selection in one direction.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
*Some discussion from my own research projects on this â¦<br />

<div class="fold">
<p>DR: For our (substitution) experiments, it is in fact not clear to me whether this should necessarily be the case, as some (less generous?) people may be induced to leave because of having been asked to donate, while potentially other (more generous people) might be induced to return given that they were asked to donate. (This proposed nonmonotonicity implies that the âasked twiceâ sample tends to weed out the less generous, which would lead to a bias <em>against</em> substitution, strengthening the case for our result.)</p>
<p>DR, aside: However, even though the paper doesnât say it, I suspect this assumption could be weakened and you would still get some similar bounds.
To put it another way, I would imagine that these bounds could be adjusted based on some reasonable ad hoc assumptions about the share of the population who is affected in either direction.</p>
â NL: Iâm coming to think that our Dutch data problems are more things involving âhurdle models.â Can this technique also be applied to such hurdle models?
</div>
<p>Next proposition 1a states that given these assumptions we can derive sharp lower and upper bounds for the average treatment effect (conditional on âwould be observed in both statesâ). Note that for this estimator if the probability of observation is greater under the treatment we need to trim the treatment groups outcome distribution and if the probability of observation is greater under the control we need to trim the control groupâs outcome distribution.</p>
<ul>
<li>DR, aside comment: we seem to be throwing out a bit of the data in these estimates, which would suggest that something more efficient could be generated.</li>
</ul>
<p>(The stated bounds you can estimate are exactly the same as the bounds from the previous specification, at least as I had interpreted the way they would be produced.)</p>
<p>Their remark 2 notes that an implication is that as <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>, that as the âdifference between the relative probability of observation of an outcome under treatment versus controlâ tends to zero,
i.e., as the probability of having an observed outcome (or the conditional probability of this) is the same for treatment and control) then there is no sample selection bias.</p>
<p>Their estimate convergences to the estimate he calls an estimate for the âalways takers subpopulationâ¦ except that takingâ¦ is selection into the [outcome-observed] sample.â</p>
<p><em>So, a very vanilla estimator is acceptable if we find the same conditional probability of selection for each group, under monotonicity, which, for this case, we can test (see Remark 4 below).</em></p>
<p>â (DR: To me this suggests that there might be something wrong going on here. Intuitively, If I simply observe the same rate of attrition in the treatment and control groups this <em>shouldnât</em> be enough to tell me that attrition did not matter, as it could occur differentially for both groups, but it seems to be a result here; this is probably due to the assumption of monotonicity of the selection/observation term, as well as the random/exogenous assignment to each group.)</p>
<hr />
<p>Remark 3 discusses the importance of monotonicity for the bounds, saying this assumption is âminimally sufficientâ (I think it would be better to say minimally sufficient for these particular bounds that he computed). To demonstrate this he gives an extreme example. Without monotonicity it could be (note: this would seem like a very unlikely outcome!) that every observation in the control group comes from the population in the treatment group that would <em>not</em> have been observed had they been treated and every observation in the treatment group happens to come from the set of people that would <em>not</em> have been observed had they been in the control group. These two âsubpopulations do not overlap, so the difference in the means could not be interpreted as a causal effect.â</p>
<p>â DR, aside : there must be some way to impose some restrictions on this even allowing for this non-monotonicity. (He notes that this can be improved upon somewhat by thinking about the total the idea that the total masses of unobserved that wouldâve been observed in the other group canât be greater than the share that is not observed in the other treatment group, but this doesnât seem like a particularly fruitful route as it in most reasonable cases will still allow for very wide bounds.)</p>
<hr />
<p>Remark 4 suggests that if we can assume (or somehow observe?) that the conditional probabilities of selection are the same for treatment and control, we can <em>test whether monotonicity in fact holds</em> and the simple difference in means will be an appropriate estimate of the treatment effect. Here, the assumption implies that everyone in the treatment or control group would have been observed under the opposite treatment as well. This in fact implies that the distribution of the exogenous variables should be the same in the treatment and control groups conditional on being selected. This seems fairly intuitive, we look at whether selection seems to be occurring in different ways are on different margins for the two groups treatment versus control.</p>
<p>Apparently for this test to have <em>power</em> we need that the subpopulations of ânoncompliant errors in opposite directionsâ (quotation mine) must have <em>distinct</em> distributions of baselines exogenous characteristics. If these were the same then whether or not monotonicity holds the test doesnât tell us anything.</p>
<p>â DR: <em>I wonder if anyone uses this test for Monotonicity under non-differential selection?</em></p>
<p>Another relevant note that he bundles in this remark is that the technique here only yields estimates <em>for those who would be with an observed outcome for either treatment or control.</em> One could <em>additionally</em> try to bound this as an estimate for the entire population using the Horwitz and Manski bounds for this latter thing. However, in many contexts there are reasons that the bounded estimates they mainly use are the relevant ones, such as âthe impact of the program on wage rates for those whose employment status was not affected by the program.â</p>
<ul>
<li>DR: In our substitution experiment case, the substitution patterns for those for whom attrition was not affected by the first-round-charity treatment</li>
<li>@NL: E.g., the impact of an institution on income for those whose choice to remain in the course was not affected by their institutional assignment</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>âNarrowing bounds using covariatesâ</p>
<p>All of the above could be done conditional on a particular set of baseline characteristics such as gender or race. The average treatment effect could be estimated separately for each. (Note: and perhaps combined in a fruitful way?)</p>
<p>One can alternately use covariates to reduce the width of these bounds. To give intuition, we can imagine a baseline covariate that perfectly predicts an individualâs wage. Because treatments are randomly assigned the maintained assumptions will still hold conditionally on this X. The results the methods can be applied separately for each value of this covariate, and for each such value the trimming procedure will actually have no impact on the estimate.</p>
<p>DR: I think this is the âestimate and sum things up in a weighted wayâ procedure I thought about a moment ago.</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>Proposition 1B gives the balance estimator for a model involving exogenous variables. Essentially, this computes the corresponding bounds estimator at each X, where the differential selection probability is computed for that particular X, the upper quantile value of the outcome is given conditional on the same X and on being in the treatment group. These are then integrated (or summed up) weighted by the distribution or the cdf of this covariate in the control group. These bounds will necessarily be sharper than the balance without controls.</p>

<p>Interesting intuitive argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another reason to interpret the evidence as pointing to positive wage effects is that the lower bound is based on an extreme and unintuitive assumptionâthat wage outcomes are perfectly negatively correlated with the propensity to be employed. From a purely theoretical standpoint, a simple labour supply model suggests that, all other things equal, those on the margin of being employed will have lowest wages not the highest wages (i.e., the âreservation wageâ will be the smallest wage that draws the individual into the labour force). In addition, the empirical evidence in Table 2 suggests that there is positive selection into employment: those who are predicted to have higher wages are more likely to be employed (i.e., U and V are positively correlated). If this is true, it seems relatively more plausible to trim the lower rather than the upper tail of the distribution to get an estimate of the treatment effect.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered">Probability sampling</h3>
<p>In the fold below, I offer a rough characterization of the rationale for probabiliity sampling, in my own words, based on my reading of the aforementioned Wikipedia entry:</p>

<div class="fold">
<p>âProbability samplingâ has been the standard approach in survey sampling since random-digit dialing was possible.</p>
<p>The basic idea, if I understand correctly, is to define a population of interest and a âsample frameâ (the place we are actually drawing from, the empirical analogue of the population of interest perhaps).
Essentially, rather than advertising or trying to recruit everyone, or have people enter by self selection, probability sampling select from the sample frame with a particular probability, and then actively tries to get the selected individuals to complete the survey. As only a smaller number of people are selected to be interviewed/fill out the survey, you can spend more time and money/incentives, trying to make sure they respond.</p>
<p>Probability sampling also allows âstratification,â and oversampling of harder to reach groups. We potentially divide up (âstratifyâ) that frame by observable groups. We randomly draw (sample) within each strata with a certain probability.</p>
<em>If we have an informative estimate of the TRUE shares in each strata</em> we can sample/re-weight so that the heterogeneous parameter of interest can be said to represent the average value for the true population of interest.
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A probability-based survey sample is created by constructing a list of the target population, called the sampling frame, a randomized process for selecting units from the sample frame, called a selection procedure, and a method of contacting selected units to enable them to complete the survey, called a data collection method or mode (lookup in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survey_sampling#Probability_sampling">Wiki</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Standard sampling and estimation techniques require the researcher to select sample members with a known probability of selection.

<li><p>Or âreach a large number of people via random digit dialing and then screen them for membership in the hidden population. Again, this approach is extremely costly and potentially very inaccurate.â</p></li>
<li><p>Or âtake a sample of target population members in an institutional settingâfor example, injection drug users in a drug rehabilitation program.â But âa nonrandom sample from the hidden population, â¦ impossible to use to â¦ make accurate estimates about the entire hidden populationâ</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Targeted sampling (âstreet outreachâ) is cost-effective but it is very hard to know what you are getting. Time-space sampling can deal with certain limitations to this, but itâs far from a complete remedy.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The authors propose:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>respondent-driven sampling, is a variation of chain-referral sampling methods that were first introduced by Coleman (1958) under the name snowball sampling.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>select a small number of seeds who are the first people to participate in the study. These seeds then recruit others to participate in the study. This process of existing sample members recruiting future sample members continues until the desired sample size is reached</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>While..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>chain-referral methods produce samples that are not even close to simple random samples</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>researchers believed that any small bias in selecting the seeds would be compounded in unknown ways as the sampling process continued.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and also â¦</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This research is fairly well summarized by Berg(1988) when he writes, âas a rule, a snowball sample will be strongly biased toward inclusion of those who have many interrelationships with or are coupled to, a large number of individuals.â In the absence of knowledge of individual inclusion probabilities in different waves of the snowball sample, unbiased estimation is not possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="marginnote">
<p><strong>âBiased toward inclusion of those who have many interrelationshipsâ¦â</strong></p>
<p>This would seem to suggest a solution, perhaps driving the approach the authors use. If we can measure the likelihood that an individual is reached as a function of their network, we may be able to downweight those individuals that are more likely to be sampled.</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But the authors believe they have a solution</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We believe that previous researchers have been overly pessimistic about chain-referral samples. In this paper we will show that it is possible to make unbiased estimates about hidden populations from
these types of samples. Further, we will show that these estimates are asymptotically unbiased no matter how the seeds are select</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How does it work?:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, the sample is used to make estimates about the social network connectingthe population. Then, this information about the social network is used to derive the proportion of the population in different groups (forexample, HIV- or HIV+)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There are some intricate and interesting calculations involving network analysis .</p>
<p>They show the unbiasedness of this approach under specified conditions, and its robustness to the seed choice. They also give a monte-carlo simulation illustrating the same.</p>
<p>Finally, they do some sort of comparison of their approach and previous approaches in real settings.**</p>

<p>Our current approach may be described as a combination of âconvenience samplingâ (âriver samplingâ and âopt-inâ) and âsnowball sampling.â The major distinction from probability sampling (as I see it) isâ¦</p>
<p><em>Probability sampling</em> identifies a <em>population of interest</em> and a <em>sample frame</em> meant to capture this population. Rather than appealing to this entire population/frame, probability sampling randomly (or using stratification/clustering) samples a âprobability shareâ (e.g., 1/1000) from this frame. Selected participants are (hopefully) given strong incentives to complete the survey. One can carefully analyze âand perhaps adjust forâthe rate of non-response.</p>
<p>In contrast,</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>I have heard that âinternet surveys,â if done right, with proper adjustments, are seen as increasingly reliable, especially in the context of electoral polling. Is our approach similar enough to this to be able to adopt these approaches?</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Wikipedia entry on âconvenience samplingâ</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another example would be a gaming company that wants to know how one of their games is doing in the market one day after its release. Its analyst may choose to create an online survey on Facebook to rate that game.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bias</strong> The results of the convenience sampling cannot be generalized to the target population because of the potential bias of the sampling technique due to under-representation of subgroups in the sample in comparison to the population of interest. The bias of the sample cannot be measured. Therefore, inferences based on the convenience sampling should be made only about the sample itself.[9] (Wikipedia, on âConvenience sampling,â cites Borenstein et al, 2017)</p>

- 'Whether we can do betterâ sort of questions ... we should try to pin down what our metrics and targets are

- For the second point, I think that some methods might yieldplausibly unbiased/reliable estimates of certain parameters (e.g., year-to-year changes) but not others.

<div id="sensitivity-testing-ideas" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered">Sensitivity testing ideas</h4>
<p>As we can separately measure demographics (as well as stated beliefs/attitudes) for respondents from each referrer, we could consider testing the sensitivity of the results to âhow we weight responses from each referrer.â</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How much would results vary if we compare the widest group to the most motivated âfirst respondersâ to our regular posted survey?</p></li>
<li><p>Use demographics derived from some weighted estimate of surveys in all previous years to re-weight the survey data in the present year to be âmore representative?â (But how to weight and judge previous surveys and referrers?)</p></li>
<li><p>A Bayesian meta-analytic approach where the âtrue population parametersâ are unknown and each survey provides an imperfect window.</p>
<ul>
<li>As noted we subjectively think that some referrers are more representative than others, so maybe we can do something with this using Bayesian tools.)
We may have some measures of the demographics of participants on some of the referrers, which might be used to consider weighting to deal with differential non-response</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p>Weighting may not be appropriate as a means of gaining âcomplete representativeness,â as we have no gold standard. Even if we had a nationally-representative sample/survey this could yield differential response rates among different types of EA-ers. An approach to âconvergent validationâ may be possible in the future, but it will take time to learn/develop a methodology.</p>
<p>However, we can measure and test the sensitivity of our results to variation along several âdimensionsâ</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ease of response/dedication (maybe compare first to later responders, responders after reminders, future â compare those with additional incentives and pressure)</p></li>
<li><p>Referrers with different characteristics (âlarge poolâ vs âsmall poolâ or something)</p></li>

<div class="marginnote">
<p>I suspect there must be substantial work on this, but Iâm just going to flesh out how I think it would probably go:</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Parameters/values:</strong>*</p>
<p>We consider both latent/unobservable âtrueâ population parameters and our observed values.</p>
<p><em>Movement population and composition (latent)</em>: The movement has a population (henceforth âour populationâ) of unknown size <span class="math inline">\(\Pi\)</span> and composition <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>.</p>
<p>âDemographicsâ <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> can either represent a single proportion, e.g., the female share of our population, or a vector of these proportions for various demographics.* For now, for simplicity, we will focus on a single demographic. Let <span class="math inline">\(\delta_0\)</span> be the male share and <span class="math inline">\(\delta_1 = 1- \delta_0\)</span> the non-male share. For indexing this simple case, we refer to demographics <span class="math inline">\(\delta_k\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(k=0,1\)</span>.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>* â¦or even a matrix or array describing each pairing of demographics.</p>
</div>
<p>E.g., if the male share is 70%, we have be <span class="math inline">\(\Pi_0= \delta_0 \Pi = 0.7\times 100 = 70\)</span> males in our population.**</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Naturally, <span class="math inline">\(\Pi_1 = \delta_1 \Pi = (1-\delta_0)\Pi = \Pi - \Pi_0 = 100-30 = 30\)</span> non-males in our population.</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As noted below, we will be targeting the population via several âreferrersâ <span class="math inline">\(r=0,1,...,R\)</span>. For now, we will assume each member of the population also only âbelongsâ to a single referrer. This is also described by <em>latent</em> parameters: we do not know what share of the population belongs to each referrer, nor how this breaks down by demographics.</p>
<p>For simplicity, consider only two referrers (<span class="math inline">\(r=0,1\)</span>), the âwide and narrow referrers,â respectively, and let <span class="math inline">\(\rho_0\)</span> denote the share of our population that belongs to the wider referrer (and <span class="math inline">\(\rho_1 = 1-\rho_0\)</span> the share belonging to the narrower referrer).***</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>*** For the case in mind when I built this example, this embodies in a place of assumption that is too strong. In fact each of our members may belong to one or more referrers, or in fact to none at all.</p>
</div>
<p>Thus, supposing 80% of our population belongs to the wider referrer, we have <span class="math inline">\(R_0= \rho_0 \Pi = 0.8\times 100 = 80\)</span> members of our population belonging to the wider referrer. (Note that we let <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> denote the ânumber of members of our population belonging to the wider referrer.â)</p>
<p>Again, we do not know how this breaks down by demographics, and it may not be even. Thus, we need to define <em>the shares of each demographic belonging to each referrer</em>:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\rho_{r_k}=pr(k=k|r=r)\)</span>: The share of the âpopulation of referrer râ that also both belongs to demographic <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>(Note â Iâm not sure if I should use this âcross proportionâ or instead use two separate proportions, i.e., conditional probabilities.)</p>
</div>
<p>In general (and defining the corresponding ânumber of observationsâ notation):</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\Pi_{rk}=\Pi\times\rho_r\times\rho_{r_k}\)</span></p>
<p>Thus, e.g., given the shares mentioned above, and assuming that 70% of the narrower referrerâs population is male (<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{1_0}=pr(k=0|r=1)) = 0.7\)</span>, our true population of âmales in the narrower referrerâ is</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\Pi_{10}=\Pi\times\rho_1\times\rho_{1_0}=100\times0.2\times0.7 = 14\)</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>Surveys/referrers and response/participation rates (observed)</em></p>
<p>We have an opt-in web survey that has been administered yearly in years <span class="math inline">\(t=0,...,T\)</span>.</p>
In each year, the survey has been advertised in one of the two referrers noted above.*.
<div class="marginnote">
<p>More generally, in <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> referrers â¦ <span class="math inline">\(r=0,1,...,R\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>We observe the number of participants coming from each referrer <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> with each demographic <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> in each year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(n_{r,k,t} \forall \: r,k,t\)</span></p>
<p>Suppose that the survey has only been run for 2 years.</p>
<p>Thus, e.g., we may observe <span class="math inline">\(n_{1,0,1}=20\)</span> from the narrower referrer, who are male, in the first year (year â0â).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>Participation âmodelâ:</em></p>
<p>I suggested above, we assume that each member of our population only observes (or only âmeaningfully observesâ) the survey from at most one referrer, the one they âbelong to.â</p>
If an individual indeed observes the survey, they then decide whether to participate.*
<div class="marginnote">
<p>* In future, we might model these participation decisions as the outcome of optimization problems, perhaps giving us insight into the direction of the bias (e.g., according to opportunity cost and concern for the outcome of the survey).</p>
</div>
<p>This is perhaps a âdouble hurdleâ: the individual may or may not observe the survey, and then may or may not decide whether it is worth participating. Separating these two processes would seem to separate the âcoverageâ and âdifferential response/participationâ issues.</p>
<p>As a result, we may have an unobserved âpropensity to participateâ for each participant, in each year, which may vary by referrer and by demographic.</p>
<p>For now, we will simplify things; We will not model the two hurdles separately, but simply refer to a âlatent propensity to (observe and) participateâ for each subgroup:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{r,k,t}\)</span>: The true probability that an individual belonging to referrer <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, who is in demographic <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> (in year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>) participates (returns the survey) in year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we had an (unbiased?) estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{r,k,t} \forall r,k,t\)</span> (and if we observe responses from each combination of these, and if the some share of each group belongs to each referrer) we should be able to use inverse probability weighting to gain an unbiased estimate of the true demographic population shares as well as the overall true population size (?).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>The parameters and the priors:</em></p>
<p>Specify some informative but still somewhat diffuse prior distribution over these parameters; Including true population shares and probabilities of response within each group.</p>

<p>Highlights: âWe propose individuals give to charity to signal smarts. We designed a laboratory experiment to test this hypothesis. We randomize the publicity of a donation and the degree of meritocracy. We find suggestive evidence that donations are used to signal smarts.â</p>
<p>But âwhat is the thing in the real world that needs testing in the lab?â</p>
<p>It is not âdo people want to signal smarts in generalâ (or if it is, there is no need for the experiment to link it to charity).</p>
<p>It is more like:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>âdo people think that donating is a signal of intelligence?â and/or</p></li>
<li><p>âdo people even consider using donations in this way?â</p></li>
</ol>
<p>But in the lab experiment both (1) and (2) are guaranteed just by the setup of the treatment. So they donât offer a way to test these, unless Iâm missing something.</p>

<p><strong>âSitzia, Stefania, and Robert Sugden.âImplementing theoretical models in the laboratory, and what this can and cannot achieve." Journal of Economic Methodology 18.4 (2011): 323-343.</strong></p>
<p>This paper is a critique of how models are claimed to be âtested,â through a literal implementation, in the laboratory. They argue this misinterprets the intention of a model, and use of economic modelling in general. Ultimately, such experiments (they say) donât really tell us one way or another about the truth or usefulness of the model for the real-world domain that was intended. Some key quotes..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My reductio ad absurdum on this is an experimenter who âtests mechanism-designâ by asking subjects âdo you want to choose this optimal mechanism and earn Â£20, or this inefficient mechanism and earn Â£10?â â givingtools on twitter</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They single-out two examples of well-published experiments for criticism: "an investigation of price dispersion by John Morgan,</p>
<p>Henrik Orzen and Martin Sefton (2006), and an investigation of information cascades by Lisa Anderson and Charles Holt (1997)"â¦</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In each case, the experimenters create a laboratory environment that closely resembles the model itself. The only important difference between the experiment and the model is that, whereas the model world contains imaginary agents who act according to certain principles of rational choice, the laboratory contains real human beings who are free to act as they wish. The decision problems that the human subjects face are exactly the problems specified by the model. We argue that such an experiment is not, in any useful sense, a test of what the model purports to say about the target domain. Instead, it is a test of those principles of rational choice that the modeller has attributed to the model world. Those principles are not specific to that model; they are generic theoretical components that are used in many economic models across a wide range of applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Surprisingly, these doubts are not expressed in terms of the applicability of MSNE [mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium] to the modelâs target domain, pricing decisions by retail firms. The doubts are about whether experimental subjects will act according to MSNE when placed in a laboratory environment that reproduces the main features of the model.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If one takes the viewpoint of the subjects themselves, there seems to be very little resemblance between the decision problems they face and those by which retail firms set their prices. The connection between the two is given by the model: the subjectsâ decision problems are like those of the firms in the model, and the firms in the model are supposed to represent firms in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>However, MOS are no more concrete than Varian in explaining how the comparative-static properties of the model relate to the real world of retail pricing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The suggestion in these passages is that the clearinghouse modelâs claim to be informative about the world is strengthened if its results are confirmed in the laboratory. In this sense the experiment is informative about the world. But the experiment itself is a test of the model, not of what the model says about the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The procedure of random and anonymous rematching of subjects is explained as a means of eliminating âunintended repeated game effects,â such as tacit collusion among sellers (pp.Â 142â3). This argument illustrates how tightly the laboratory environment is being configured to match the model. In a test of MSNE, repeated game effects are indeed a source of contamination; and MSNE is a property of Varianâs model. But in the target domain of retail trade, the same firms interact repeatedly in the same markets, with opportunities for tacit collusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clearly, if an experiment implemented a model in its entirety, all that it could test would be the mathematical validity of the modelâs results. Provided one were confident in the modellerâs mathematics, experimental testing would be pointless. Thus, when an experiment implements almost every feature of a model, all it can test in addition to mathematical validity are those features that have not been implemented.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the experiment is a test of MSNE in a specific class of games. [emphasis added]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MSNE is what we will call a generic component of economic models â a piece of ready-to-use theory which economists insert into models with disparate target domain</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>ibid</li>
</ul>
<p>Relating back to the discussion of the different conceptions of theory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it informative at all to run experimental tests of theoretical principles such as MSNE and Bayesian rationality, viewed as generic components of economic models? â¦ A strict instrumentalist (taking a position that is often attributed to Friedman) might answer âNoâ to the first question, on the grounds that tests should be directed only at the predictions of theories and not at their assumptions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Such an experimental design should not be appraised in terms of what the model purports to say about its target domain. It should be appraised in terms of what it can tell us about the relevant generic component, considered generically. When (as in the cases of MSNE and Bayesian rationality) the same theoretical component appears in many different models, an experimenter can afford to be selective in looking for a suitable design for a test</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Considered simply as a test of MSNE, MOSâs experiment uses extraordinarily complicated games. Many of the canonical experiments in game theory use 2Ã2 games. Depending on the treatment, MOSâs games are either 101Ã101 (for two players) or 101Ã101Ã101Ã101 (for four players). Payoffs to combinations of strategies are determined by a formula which, although perhaps intuitive to an economist (it replicates the demand conditions of the clearinghouse model), might not be easy for a typical subject to grasp.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>âBut all the other papers do it!â</strong></p>
<p>A common response to critiques (particularly critiques of the generalizability of experimental work) is that âall the other papers have the same problemâ and that excepting this critique would require rejecting all previous work too. In politics this has been referred to as âwhat-about-ism.â</p>
<p>You can guess that Iâm not a fan of this. I think one always needs to defend the paper and approach on its own merits. Generalisability is an important issue. Each of the other published papers that also suffers from such issues has a specific response and justification for that particular case, and if it doesnât this is sorely lacking.</p>
<p>I think we <em>should</em> be reading and publishing papers that consider, discuss, and acknowledge their own limitations, and future work can test and build on this. This should promote to robust, reproducable science.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Just because I say âthis is something we should be concerned withâ doesnât mean Iâm saying âthis paper has no valueâ. I just meanâletâs discuss reasons why this may or may not threaten internal or external validity/generalisability, and how we can design the study and analysis minimise these potential problems""</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In writing a paper, I find it important that <em>we the authors</em> feel the results are credible and not overstated. So I feel like the best approach is âletâs write the best paper we can and consider every issue seriously, and then hopefully the good publication/peer-review outcome will follow.â Thatâs also the most motivating and least stressful way for me to work. (Rather than thinking âhow can I sneak this paper into the best journal?â)</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>In fact I consider peer review and rating as the important outcome, not the publication itself. We live in a world where anyone can publish their work immediately on the WWW. The journals themselves are providing little or no service: it is the reviewers and editors offering feedback and evaluation that matters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>BB: That said, I would be interested to think about the benefits â and more importantly limitations to â pre-registration. I think it could solve some of the p-hacking problems but not much else. How to not relegate exploratory analyses too far is also unclear to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>DR: Iâm much more on the âproâ side pre-registration and PaPs. It also helps deal with publication bias and file drawers. And p-hacking is a huge issue IMHO. But it is also good to have some consideration of the pros and cons, so this would be great.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>BB: RE pre-reg: yes I think it is enough that it prevents p-hacking (there could be very little cost associated with pre-reg) but I fear that it could prevent other advancements if it relegates exploratory analyses too far.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>DR: I donât think it should be binary. Systems need to be worked out for <em>adjustments</em> to the meaning of reported estimates depending on whether they were or were not preregistered, and how many were preregistered. While reported significance levels could be adjusted in the frequentist framework, this will all presumably based on measures of the likelihood that such a result would have been estimated/reported. Thus I think this could most easily be incorporated into a Bayesian framework but Iâm not saying it would be easy. Still, they have done some good work on adjustments for âsequential designs.â</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BB: I think that it could also stifle students a bit â it may reduce further the number of students who have access to funding that allows for experiments that will be able to be published if all experiments have to be high-powered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DR: Statistical power is an important issue. I was skeptical at first about the âdangers of underpowered studiesâ but maybe Iâm coming around a bit.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>My thinking was that âwe can simply make downward adjustments to the estimates reported in underpowered studies.â See the discussion under <a href="#power">power calculations</a>.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyways, we donât want to put the cart before the horse: as Gelman said at a conference we should be supporting science not the careers of scientists. I tend to think there are strong arguments for more centralization in social science.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And my impression is that we actually have too many different studies and distinct research programs being run, and too many papers being published and not carefully brought together into a framework. Going through the studies on the <a href="https://www.replicationmarkets.com/" class="uri">https://www.replicationmarkets.com/</a> reinforces this impression for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Still, I think there are ways around this to enable early career people. âUnderpoweredâ experiments could be registered as part of a longer/sequential research program, perhaps collaborative and enabling meta-analysis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BB: I also donât think it gets at publication bias very much unless pre-regâed studies are followed up on. Only then do you know why the study didnât come out â and quite a lot of the time I think it will be attrition/inability to gather the necessary data. Someone could launch that journal though â the Journal of Failed Studies â to have a place for a record that they have been run and what happened to be kept. So I am pro pre-reg, I just think the system needs a bit of work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DR: If preregistration is made public and well-organize, then the âfailedâ exercises willtbe integrated into future meta-analyses; so thatâs at least a partial solution here.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Agreed, we need to build better systems for incentivising pre-registration and careful data sharing. We need to give career credit to people for planning designing and reporting credible experiments and projects, even if they âfail.â Part this is publishing/rewarding tight null results, which actually do add a lot of value.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We might also consider offering some reward careerwise to experiments that fail â in terms of being deeply inconclusiveâ for some arbitrary or random reason even though they were well-planned and executed. But I think it is hard to get the incentives right for the latter.</p>

<p>Yet â¦</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(P_{augmented}\)</span> may <em>overstate</em> type-1 error rate Statistics/econometrics response to referees, new-statistics "</p>
<p>A process involving stopping âwhenever the nominal <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 0.05\)</span>â and gathering more data otherwise (even rarely) must yield a type-1 error rate above 5%. Even if the subsequent data suggested a âone in a million chance of arising under the nullâ the overall process yields a 5%+ error rate. The NHST frequentist framework can not adjust ex-post to consider the âlikelihood of the null hypothesisâ given the observed data, in light of the shocking one-in-a-million result. While Bayesian approaches can address this, we are not highly familiar with these methods; however, we are willing to pursue this if you feel it is appropriate.</p>
<p>Considering the calculations in , it is clear that <span class="math inline">\(p_{augmented}\)</span> should  the type-1 error of the process if there is a positive probability that after an initial experiment attains p<span class="math inline">\(&lt;0.05\)</span>, more data is collected. A headline <span class="math inline">\(p&lt;0.05\)</span> does  imply that this result will enter the published record. Referees may be skeptical of other parts of the design or framework or motivation. They may also choose to reject the paper specifically because of this issue; they believe the author would have continued collecting data had the result yielded <span class="math inline">\(p&gt;0.05\)</span>, thus they think it is better to demand more evidence or a more stringent critical value. Prompted by the referee, the author may collect more data even though <span class="math inline">\(p&lt;0.05\)</span>. Or, she may decide to collect more data even without a referee report/rejection demanding it, for various reasons (as we did after our Valentineâs experiment). Thus, we might imagine that there is some probability that after (e.g.) an initial experiment attaining p&lt;0.05, more data is collected, implying that <span class="math inline">\(p_{augmented}\)</span> as calculated above overstates the type I error rate that would arise from these practices. As referees and editors, we should be concerned about the status of knowledge as accepted by the profession, i.e., in published papers. If we recognize the possibility of data augmentation after any paper is rejected, it might be a better practice to require a significance standard substantially below <span class="math inline">\(p=0.05\)</span>, in order to attain a type-1 error rate of 5% or less in our published corpus."</p>

A guiding principle might be:
"Will we have statistical power to identify a small true effect from this pairing? If not, we drop the pairing."

A caveat to this is that we may be able to pool some of the pairings to answer certain questions, but then it is only worth having the distinct variations that are being pooled if that doing so gives us power to answer some other question.

<div class="fold">
<blockquote>
<p>R: In a âpolicyâ context, where we want to decide which message to use, and we are not necessarily trying to establish a very robust general result for scientific purposes, I would err on the side of more messages perhaps</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>M: Thatâs very interesting. I may just defer to what you think, but my intuitions would have been the reverse in terms of the practical policy vs academic/generalisation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK it really depends on the context and the cost/benefit of having confidence in a particular result.</p>
<p>E.g., p&lt;0.01 vs profitable Bayesian updating (âliftâ etc)
In academia (Economics anyway) there is still the old-line insistence that âthe result you present must be strongly statistically significant in a frequentist test or it is not publishable.â
In business practice a result may be highly valuable even if it is something like âthere is an 80% chance that message A works better than message B, and the mean additional âliftâ of message A is +$50,000, with an 80% credible interval of (0,$50,000) and a 95% CI of (-$20k, +$70K)</p>
<p>But academia also cares about âdeepâ and âfancyâ mechanisms stuff: academia asks âis this question interesting, can you rule out alternative hypothesis, etc â¦ motivating one to have more treatments/outcomes as long as you can âget p&lt;0.01â for rejecting a (perhaps trivial null). So academia compares A1,A2,A3, B1,B2,B3, C1, C2,â¦ etc.</p>
<p>While business might find it more valuable to gain greater insight into âwhether A outperforms Bâ even if we donât know why. It may not care about testing A1 vs A2 if there is little practical difference between the two.</p>
<p>And âacademic publication incentivesâ doesnât care much about precision after we âget p&lt;0.01â
E.g., if my paper shows that the some âearly donation seedâ raises (p&lt;0.01 significantly) more funds than no such seed, âpublication-wiseâ I may not care much about bounding the size of this effect, nor about bounding a measure the size of the optimal seed.</p>
<p>But as a business (or EA org etc) I know these seeds are costly, and I may only want to do it if I have a certain level of confidence that it will be substantially above the cost of the seed, perhaps considering the risk/return tradeoffs. I may also find it valuable to have an extremely precise measure of the optimal seed.</p>

<p>The âstatistical powerâ of an analysis is the probability that this analysis diagnoses that âan effect is presentâ (or a parameter is nonzero). The power of an analysis can only considered in light of (as a function of)</p>
<ul>
<li>a particular <em>true effect size</em> (parameter magnitude),</li>
<li>or an effect size stated as relative to the underlying dispersion,</li>
<li>or as âthe probability of achieving a certain desired precision.â*</li>

<p>There are several reasons to consider power and to do âpower calculationsâ in advance of running an experiment or doing an analysis.</p>
<p>An âunderpowered studyâ is one with a low likelihood of diagnosing a âsubstantialâ effect is present when it <em>is</em> present. Such a study is also likely to be an <em>uninformative</em> study. Furthermore, if ârejecting a particular null hypothesisâ is important**, an underpowered test is unlikely to reject this null hypothesis even when it is âsubstantially and meaningfully false.â</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>** But please see McElreath and otherâs discussion about the follies of the ways NHST is used in science on this point.</p>
</div>
<p>An underpowered study is likely to yield wide âconfidence intervalsâ (or wide âposterior Bayesian credible intervalsâ). Simply put, after an underpowered study (at least in isolation), we still wonât have a good sense of what the true value (of the parameter or effect of interest) is.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>All else equal, you want to run a study that is <em>as high-powered as possible</em> (or a study that is part of a larger project that collectively yields substantial power) because:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>you want your study to be informative and to contribute to science (empirical analysis) and</p></li>
<li><p>âlow powered studiesâ (at least in certain publication contexts) can potentially <a href="underpowered">harm the accuracy of our scientific consensus</a>.</p></li>

<p>A power analysis may allow you to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>consider the <strong>cost/benefits of âmore dataâ</strong>, to help you determine âhow much to collect,â</p></li>
<li><p>consider and <strong>optimise over the tradeoffs in design choices</strong> (e.g., introducing more treatments usually involves a loss of power), and</p></li>
<li><p>understand whether you â<strong>have enough funds</strong> to gather enough data to make it worth doing a study?â</p></li>
<li><p>(maybe) be more credible in making ex-post statements about null effects.*</p></li>
</ul>
Furthermore, if you are trying to do a replication exercise to diagnose the credibility of previous work you want to be able to claim âI have power to do this credibly.â*

<p>In general, power analyses and ensuring sufficient power is good for science, avoiding the harm from âunderpowered studies.â There are arguments that individual <a href="#underpowered">âunderpoweredâ studies may undermine science</a>, particular in conjunction with âpublication bias.â</p>

<h4 class="unnumbered">Considering: âshould I use a function of previous estimated effect sizes to determine the MESOI?â</h4>
<p>From David Moss (unfold)</p>

<div class="fold">
<p>Moss:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>â¦ not basing power calculations on previously observed effect sizes?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lakens uses the SESOI approach, which we often do, but SESOI can be specified based on the effect sizes previous found in the literature <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245918770963">though obviously there are a bunch of ways to do it</a></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Moss, citing Lakens: â¦ use earlier work to decide which effect sizes are deemed to be âmeaningful,â with particular specific recommendations:</p>

<div class="fold">
<blockquote>
<p>Subjective justification of a smallest effect size of interest â¦ Second, the SESOI can be based on related studies in the literature. Ideally, researchers who publish novel research would always specify their SESOI, but this is not yet common practice. It is thus up to researchers who build on earlier work to decide which effect size is too small to be meaningful when they examine the same hypothesis. Simonsohn (2015) recently proposed setting the SESOI as the effect size that an earlier study would have had 33% power to detect.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With this small-telescopes approach, the equivalence bounds are thus primarily based on the sample size in the original study. For example, consider a study in which 100 participants answered a question, and the results were analyzed with a one-sample t test. A two-sided test with an alpha of .05 would have had 33% power to detect an effect of d = 0.15. Another example of how previous research can be used to determine the SESOI can be found in Kordsmeyer and Penke (2017), who based the SESOI on the mean of effect sizes reported in the literature. Thus, in their replication study, they tested whether they could reject effects at least as extreme as the average reported in the literature. Given random variation and bias in the literature, a more conservative approach could be to use the lower end of a confidence interval around the meta-analytic estimate of the effect size (cf.Â Perugini, Gallucci, &amp; Costantini, 2014).</p>
</blockquote>
Another justifiable option when choosing the SESOI on the basis of earlier work is to use the smallest observed effect size that could have been statistically significant in a previous study. In other words, the researcher decides that effects that could not have yielded a p less than <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> in an original study will not be considered meaningful in the replication study either, even if those effects are found to be statistically significant in the replication study. The assumption here is that the original authors were interested in observing a significant effect, and thus were not interested in observed effect sizes that could not have yielded a significant result. It might be likely that the original authors did not consider which effect sizes their study had good statistical power to detect, or that they were interested in smaller effects but gambled on observing an especially large effect in the sample purely as a result of random variation. Even then, when building on earlier research that does not specify a SESOI, a justifiable starting point might be to set the SESOI to the largest effect size that, when observed in the original study, would not have been statistically significant.
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>DR response: Why do we assume previous authors considered MESOI?</p>

<div class="fold">
<p>Iâm missing the logic in the quotes above as to âwhy the previously detected affects, or some bounds on these should represent the minimum effect size of interest?â</p>
<p>Perhaps there is some justification in âassuming that previous authors have powered their study correctly to detect such a minimum affects,â But to me this just seems like kicking the can down the road and I do not assume this in general. We know that people run under powered studies all the time (see the previous discussion on the harm to science)</p>
</div>
<p>DR: A second reason why one might see that as the âminimum effect size of interestâ simply has to do with being able to publish a paper that can in some way ârefuteâ previous claimed findings.</p>

<div class="fold">
<p>But that is flawed, in my view, as a way of doing science. We should power the study that is most informative, either by itself, or when made part of a meta analysis. I donât see the value of this adversarial back-and-forth approach.</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>DR preferred approach - power a study based on policy concerns, also considering itâs use in meta-analysis.</p>

<div class="fold">
<p>One basic argument is: I want to power a study as a practical goal based on my policy concerns. Typically the value of the study will depend on how precisely you are able to estimate and âboundâ a parameter. (This may be expressed as a conference interval or a credible interval if we are thinking of a Bayesian posterior).</p>
<p>So, in determining how much power I wish to achieve, I need to weigh the benefits of this precision against the cost of a larger sample size.</p>
<p>This is a very different considerations from âwhat power do I have to detect that a previously estimated effect size, if true, is âstatistically significantââ (By the standard definition).</p>
</div>
<p>Of course âWe should powerâ is subject to constraints and cost concerns.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>So, when I am designing the study I am almost never able to have the power I want for all possible tests/hypotheses. Where these considerations come into play, is whether to decide to run the study now or wait to get more funding, and in considering which hypotheses to test and which treatments to put in the study, et cetera</p>

<h2 number="14.3"><span class="header-section-number">14.3</span> The âharm to scienceâ from running underpowered studies</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"One worries about underpowered tests. Your result (may have) relatively large effect sizes that are still insignificant, which makes me wonder whether it has low power. Low powered studies undermine the reliability of our results.
- From an anonymous referee report</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps most of us consider power largely in thinking about</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>âIs our analysis going to be fruitful for ourselves as researchers?â</li>
</ol>
<p>and perhaps also, where we find a null resultâ¦</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>âIs the analysis powerful enough to plausibly rule out an effect of a meaningful size?â</li>
</ol>
<p>The conventional wisdom has been that, at least for papers reporting non-null effects, running a low-power study is mostly done at the authorsâ <em>own</em> peril. We might think âif I am lucky enough to observe a strong effect in an low-powered study then I have managed to mine a vein of truth on a relatively unproductive plot, and have thus earned my reward.â</p>
<p>However <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-buttonPowerFailureWhy2013" role="doc-biblioref">Button et al. 2013</a>)</span> point out that running lower-powered studies reduces the positive predicted valueâthe probability that a âpositiveâ research finding reflects a true effectâof a typical study reported to find a statistically significant result.</p>
<p>In combination with publication bias, this could lead a large rate of type-1 error in our body of scientific knowledge (false-positive cases, where the true effect was null and the authors had a very âluckyâ draw). True non-null effects will be underrepresented, as underpowered tests will too-often fail to detect (and publish) these. Furthermore, in both cases (true null, true non-null), underpowered tests will be far more likely to find a significant result when they have a random draw that estimates an effect size substantially larger than the true effect size. Thus, the published evidence base will tend to overstate the size of effects.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>DR: However, I speculate that this idea might be less clear-cut than it seems. E.g., if we consider a (ânon-sparseâ) world where every factor indeed has an effect, lower powered studies are more likely to detect effects that are truly larger, which are arguably more policy-relevant; moreover, overstated effect sizes might be adjusted with a standard correction.</p>

<p>â¦ if you are looking at an under-powered design then sure, you might pick up a significant result which is actually spurious. But on top of that even if there is a genuine effect there, the effect that you actually pick up as being significant will (likely) be overestimated. The intuition behind that result is (I think) that for an effect to be picked up in a study then it has to be large enough to overcome the issue that you face with power. Low-powered studies can only detect really large effects, and so the large effect you pick up in such a study could be genuine, but it equally could be a poorly-estimated coefficient. By using a low powered study you sift through for these kind of effects.</p>

<div id="assign-notes" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered">Assignment procedures to consider</h4>
<p>We consider three categories of possible assignment criteria: (We are coding these <a href="#assign-functions">below</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>1. Simple data-based</strong></p>
<p>(Coded <a href="#power-simple">here</a>)</p>
<p>Here we imagine a very simple dynamic assignment to treatments with alternation (or repeated from an urn with one ball per treatment, refilling the urn once empty). This procedure will essentially guarantee an equal share of observations in each treatment.</p>
<p>We will also consider an unbalanced design, both in this and in other categories, which may achieve greater power, especially considering the differential costs of our treatments.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Although as we have no evidence on the treatments and thus no reason to anticipate a differential variance between treatments and control, an unbalanced design may allow greater power for the same <em>cost</em>, as observing controls is costless, and the âlow-donationâ treatment is lower cost.</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>2. Ad-hoc (Reinstein adapts Barrios), using prediction.Rmd quantiles</strong></p>
<p><em>General summary:</em> Fit a predictive model of the outcome (total donations) based on pre-treatment observables, using set-aside training data. Generate quantiles of âpredicted donationâ (tuning parameter=number of quantiles?). Power-test block randomisation with these blocks as quantiles, using set-aside testing data.</p>
<p><em>Caveats:</em> If we test the power with multiple models on the test data (e.g., âtuningâ the number of quantiles) we will be overly optimistic and maybe overfitting.</p>
<p>Also, this assignment procedure is not necessarily robust to TE heterogeneity. By luck, it may assign substantial <em>imbalance</em> across any particular dimension.</p>

</div>
Blocking process (folded)

<div class="fold">
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We can test block randomization by the predicted quantile of this model with a bootstrapped procedure using set-aside âtestingâ data not used in the above regression. We want to run the simulations until we find the optimal âblock widthâ or quantile to use for blocking the randomization. Ideally, this procedure should take into account the fact that if we stopped at a random time we may have uneven cell sizes.</li>
</ol>
<p>(Caveat â this resampling may need to be done based a randomised âstart timeâ to address random time-specific effects. ) <em>Note</em>: Because of this and for feasibility, we may abridge step 5, and just try out a few reasonable large block widths (e.g., quartiles)</p>
<p>Probably the way to do this is, for each proposed block width (e.g., quartiles, deciles, 15 bins, etc) we draw random samples from the set-aside data according to this procedure, and estimate an âeffect sizeâ for each sample. We then consider the 99% bounds of these simulated effect sizes. The block width (and regularization parameter?) that consistently gives us the tightest bounds should be the one that allows us the greatest power to rule out an effect of a certain size, given the null hypothesis of no treatment effect.</p>
<p>The intuition: The smaller the largest difference in mean total donations (between treatment and control) that occurs by chance in 99% of drawsâ¦ the smaller the <em>actual</em> effect that we will be powered to detect (able to judged as statistically significant a reasonable share of the time). [Note: these latter notes may bot go with the procedure proposed below; these are older.]</p>

<h2 number="14.6"><span class="header-section-number">14.6</span> Digression: Power calculations/optimal sample size for âliftâ in a ranking case</h2>
<p>We want to know what the âbest title for our new movieâ is. Twenty titles have been suggested. We have funds to do a survey of a relevant representative audience.</p>
<p>We need to decide on a general experimental design, a statistical analysis, and on sample sizes considering power (or perhaps âliftâ).</p>
<p>Note that although we are mainly framing this in terms of statistical inference, it might also/instead be considered a âreinforcement learningâ problem.*</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>* See Max Kasyâs slides and articles on <a href="https://maxkasy.github.io/home/files/slides/adaptive_field_slides_kasy.pdf">adaptive field experiments</a>, particularly considering âexploration sampling.â</p>
</div>
<p>A long debate on this in the folds below:</p>
<p><strong>Is classical statistical inference the right framing here?</strong></p>

<div class="fold">
<p>David: I think classical statistical inference is the wrong framing here* o think about âwhat sample size (or number of arms) to maximise valueâ â¦ even if we donât do adaptive sampling</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matt: Iâm (currently) not sure there is any meaningful alternative (or, therefore, a better alternative)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David: The reinforcement-learning and value-maximization (lift) framework used in industry (I believe). The challenge here would be to map between the survey responses given and the actual outcomes of interestâ¦ e.g., if a person responds âI would definitely watch a movie with this title,â what is the probability they actually will, relative to someone who responds âI might watchâ¦â (also, what is the âpopulation sizeâ we are sampling from, to understand the scale)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matt (âThe challenge here would be to map between the survey responses given and the actual outcomes of interestâ) This is the thing Iâm just assuming we cannot do. Given that, itâs just not clear how reinforcement learning framework helps us?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David: why not make reasonable assumptions about the above, for example? But even if we framed it strictly in terms of âwhat we learn about how the population would respond to similar questions asked in the survey,â I still donât see why (e.g.) our goal should be to be âstrongly powered to reject an H0 that âall titles rank just as highly on averageâ. Instead we want to âlearn as much as possible about whatever we think, in the survey, is likely to be the most valuable responseâ</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Is there a better approach to determining sample size?</strong></p>

<div class="fold">
<blockquote>
<p>Matt: <strong>What is the better approach to determining sample size?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>David: Itâs a cost/benefit calculation. If we are cost-constrained, this question becomes âhow many arms (titles)â and âis this worth doing.â NHST framework logic may say âgiven your budget, only try 2 titles, and even if you have to choose them at randomâ and/or âdonât bother, the chance of statistical significance is too low.â</p>
<p>In contrast (my loosely-informed guess is that) a RL approach says that (if we cannot do adaptive learning, if the âclientâ finds it equally likely that all 20 titles are optimal, the âmost value-increasing learningâ (highest âliftâ) will simply come from dividing their budget equally across all 20 titles and choosing the one that âperforms bestâ (obviously âperforms bestâ is another can of worms) â¦ even if this yields little power for strong statistical inference.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matt: The approach I describe/propose (using classical approach to power analysis/hypothesis testing) also involves cost/benefit calculation. So I think this misdescribes the contrast.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David: You write âcan detect Y size effects for X dollars while testing 20 titles vs can detect Z size effects for X dollars while testing 10 titles.â But I donât think âcan detect Y effect sizesâ is entirely accurate/descriptive.</p>
<p>CLASSICAL (NHST): At a certain cost you can achieve a certain probability (power) that you will conclude that a particular difference is âless than 5% likely to occur by chance under H0.â However: 1. Even if you donât âreject the null,â the evidence (if interpreted using Bayesian methods) may already suggest that the null is very unlikely and the center of your belief distribution should be substantially shifted. 2. How does the Classical approach weigh the benefit of learning more about a few titles vs less about many titles?</p>

<p>Matt: (setting aside number of titles question): NHST approach doesnât tell us what sample size is best given the cost/benefit. NHST just tells us what sample size we need to have power to do X. Our overall judgement about what sample size to use (and what design etc.) is based on our independent judgements about what amount of cost/power is optimal..</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Matt: I think may explain some of the apparent disagreement where you propose some approach to cost/benefit as some alternative to NHST, whereas I think NHST and the cost/benefit calculation of what we should do are separate questions On my approach we also judge cost/benefit of having a given level of power to detect an effect of a given size (and a given number of titles). So whatâs the alternative approach to establishing sample size required for [a certain level of precision/ability to detect effect.. construed in whatever terms you like], and separately judging what level is optimal given the cost?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DR: I think these are linked questions, and it is not meaningful to simply state âpower to detect an effectâ â¦ as there are something like 20 x 20 possible âeffectsâ we could be looking for here.</p>

<strong>Related discussion: should âAchieving a minimum statistical significance for a particular comparisonâ be our criterion?</strong></p>

<div class="fold">
<p>David: âAchieving a minimum statistical significance for a particular comparisonâ should probably not be our criterion â¦ we can generate a lot of value even without being able to make a strong statistical inference (ârejecting the nullâ¦ mehâ)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matt: This seems a separate question.
The fundamental Q here just seems to be how much confidence we want/need to think this valuable to our decision-making. Statistical significance is an arbitrary threshold: but point remains that &lt;significant results give less value Concretely, I would update little on noisy, less significant differences results</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David: My impression is that âoptimalâ Bayesian updating, even starting with diffuse priors, actually does move a lot in response to data that would not yield strongly significant results. Yes, it does update less with less data and more noisy data, but it still updates a lot in ways that substantially change decisions and add value even in cases where NHST yawns and says ânothing to see here, move on.â If âp=0.25â in a NHST statistical test, that (very loosely and probably not strictly correct here) might suggest that âthere is a 25% chance that one option is substantially better.â (I do think there is a place for NHST in scientific inquiry and âestablishing results without giving the benefit of the doubt. But where you âmust make a decisionâ a different approach is justified IMHO).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matt: I agree that non-sig results can be worth updating on and potentially useful for practical purposes. We could have a meaningful discussion about how confident/precise we want our estimates to be / how small an effect is worth measuring without thereby ditching NHST: and you could argue that we should shoot for a lower level of power. Itâs not clear thereâs a simply better alternative framework for approaching the question. (Even translating these discussions into Bayesian terms seems to just leave us in exactly same position)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David: Not sure if itâs the same position; see above (previous fold, âitâs a cost/benefit calculationâ)</p>
<p>Mostly I agree with what you are saying but you may be missing some of the complications here. The problem is not uni-dimensional, as we are asked to consider a large set of (20) titles.
I am claiming that you might gain more value, and indeed substantial value, from learning âa little about 20 titlesâ instead of âa lot about 2 randomly selected titlesâ</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matt: Question of the value of 20 titles vs 2 titles seems distinct from the question of how much we can learn from noisy/sub-significant results. (Links other postâ¦)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>â¦ informed guess about what would be worth measuring.. In the simple case, this just involves comparing $X vs can detect Y size effects In the slightly more complex case this also involves comparing: âcan detect Y size effects for X dollars while testing 20 titlesâ vs âcan detect Z size effects for X dollars while testing 10 titles.â</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Concretely I have been informing my judgement of how small an effect we might want to detect based on our prior XXX message testing which found (by convention) small effects, and which seems as reasonable a proxy for what we might expect to find here. As noted, the key ingredient to better knowing how big an effect we want to be able to detect would be knowing how well these ratings correspond to real world differences, but we do not know thatâ¦ Of course there is also a hard ceiling on [costs] i.e.Â our client wonât/canât pay more than X dollars â¦</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I agree that focusing on 2 random titles out of the 20 would probably provide little practical value as to which out of the proposed titles is best (due to providing no data about 18/20 titles).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David: :)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the other extreme: if a test with 100 titles would only be able to detect effects that were enormous (given resource constraints on our sample size)- then itâs likely we should change test/test fewer titles, because a test that wonât be able to detect reasonable effect sizes with reasonable power, wonât be able to offer practically significant evidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David: I was thinking of the same reductio that I think you are getting at here, and I think the answer may be âstrictly speaking yes, if our prior is that all titles have identical distributions on average, better to test each title 1x than to test some titles 2x or more. For decision-making purposes, you learn the most and update the most from the first piece of evidence. So I think it actually would be practically significant to the decision problem. Highly recommended: read/listen to that Bayes Rule chapter of Algorithms to live by.</p>

<p>Suppose we asked each subject to rank all <span class="math inline">\(K=20\)</span> titles.</p>
<p>How could we <strong>test if there were any âsubstantial difference in the title rankingsâ</strong> and what would be a meaningful measure of the âextentâ of this difference?

<div class="marginnote">
<p>* However, it is not clear why this is the most relevant question.

<p><em>We might frame our test and power calculation as the following:</em></p>
<p>Suppose the âMinimal effect of interestâ that we want to be able to detect is (sort of the âalternative hypothesis HAâ)â¦</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HA: âOne title is ranked by a share of the population that is one and a half times as high as any other title.â</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If all the other titles have the same (lower) ranking on average, this should offer the greatest chance of detecting such a difference. Thus, if we assume all other titles share the same average ranking, the computations (below) should <em>underestimate</em> the necessary sample size.</p>
<p>I.e., defining <span class="math inline">\(r_{k,i}\)</span> as the rank given to title <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> by subject <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, and letting <span class="math inline">\(\bar{R^1_i}=\frac{1}{N}\sum I(r_{k,i}=1)\)</span> be the share of the sampled population (subjects) ranking title <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> as firstâ¦</p>
<p>we may consider a case where <span class="math inline">\(\bar{R^1_j} &gt; \frac{3}{2}\frac{1}{19}\sum_{k\neq j}\bar{R^1_k}\)</span> for some title <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> relative to all other titles <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.*</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>I think the latter term may simply be <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3}{2}\frac{19}{2}\)</span>, or something similar, the âaverage rank.â</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Perhaps, we want to power our test so, for the âHAâ described above, we have an 80% chance that we âfind an effect.â</strong> I.e., an 80% chance that our test statistic (whatever it is) tells us that âit is less than 5% likely that this title would have performed as well in our sample by chance if (H0) all titles been perceived as equally good and thus randomly ranked in the population.â**</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>** However, I donât really think that that is <em>really</em> what we are looking for, as we are facing a <em>decision</em> problem.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>To test for this</strong> we would follow a certain procedure, e.g.,**</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>*** I am not sure this is an appropriate procedure.</p>
</div>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Find the title âjâ that has the most people in our <em>sample</em> who rank it first; call this share <span class="math inline">\(\bar{R^1_j}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Compute (perhaps through simulation) the probability that, if all titles were randomly ranked by the population, in a sample of size <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> (our actual sample size), the average rank of the highest-ranked title would be as high as <span class="math inline">\(\bar{R^1_j}\)</span>.****</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>**** Ideally there is an analytical formula for this; worth looking up.</p>

<li><p>If this computed âprobability of such an extreme result,â given our sample size <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>â<span class="math inline">\(P(N, \bar{R^1_j})\)</span>â is below our threshold <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.05\)</span> we âreject the null.â</p></li>
</ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We have defined a (design and) testing procedure. We can now <strong>simulate</strong> (or perhaps analytically calculate) <strong>the power (of our design and test) to detect the above HA</strong>, as follows.</p>
<p>Run <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> simulations <span class="math inline">\((t=1,...,T)\)</span>. For each simulated sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> observations from an imagined âtrue population,â i.e.,
<ul>
<li>for each of the <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> subjects drawn, say, âsubject <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>,â for each of their âranks <span class="math inline">\(r=1,2,..,20\)</span>,â draw a title (by random) to be assigned this rank (<span class="math inline">\(r_{k,i}=r\)</span>),</li>
<li>with one title (the same one always) having a <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{21}\)</span> probability of being drawn for the first rank, and the other 19 titles each having a <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{21}\)</span> probability of being drawn for the first rank</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Compute <span class="math inline">\([\bar{R^1_j}]^t\)</span>: the average rank for each title in simulation <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>,
<ul>
<li>and then compute (or simulate) <span class="math inline">\(P(N, [\bar{R^1_j}]^t) \equiv [P]^t\)</span>, the test statistic as defined above, the âlikelihood of such an extreme result under the null hypothesis of random ranksâ</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Over a sufficient number of simulations, determine the average probability of ârejecting the nullâ in favor of the above HA (specifically for the âcorrectâ title <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>).* This is the estimated power of the test.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>* This last point is a wrinkle Iâve not seen in previous work involving power calculations, so I hope I am not missing something here. Perhaps we should say something like âpower of the test in the right direction.â</p>

<h4 class="unnumbered">Calc. 2: Find a title in the top <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> (e.g., third) of the âvalue of titleâ distribution (with simple assignment)</h4>
<p>For any target outcome (movie box office, general acclaim, etc.), each of the (<span class="math inline">\(K=20\)</span>) titles will have some <em>true population parameter</em>.</p>
Let us call the parameter of interest <span class="math inline">\(\theta_k\)</span> for title <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, which we will call the âvalue of title <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.â For now, let us assume that this âpopulation parameterâ represents the mean (or some other function?) of something that we can observe in our survey from each sampled subject.*
<div class="marginnote">
<p>* Of course, for this example, and in general, there are many reasons why we may not be able to observe exactly the thing that informs our parameter from a particular survey. Our survey/experiment design may not be able to get subjects to tell us exactly what we want to know about their impressions of the title. (E.g., they may not themselves know which title would be most likely to get them to attend the film. Even if we ask them something related to this like, âwould you like us to email you a discount coupon for a movie with his title?â this may not perfectly track with movie-attendance choices in other contexts.</p>
</div>
Consider a â(prior) distribution over parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta_k\)</span> for each title <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.â**
<div class="marginnote">
<p>** I wonât get into the details here about what this distribution means in a philosophical sense. There are various types of Bayesian conceptions of this. Perhaps another way of thinking about it is that each title was as if randomly drawn from some distribution of titles.</p>
</div>
<p>Without further information, we might let (our belief about) the distribution of this parameter for each title be the same. We might consider that, e.g., the âexpected revenue from each titleâ is Normally distributed <span class="math inline">\(\theta_k \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2) \forall k\)</span>.</p>
<p>Perhaps each subjectâs ranking of titles is monotonic (i.e., rank-preserving) in the true probability that they would attend a movie with each of these titles.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Perhaps, we want to choose a sample size such that the title we claim has the âbest overall ranking in our sampleâ has a <span class="math inline">\(B=0.8\)</span> or greater chance of being in the top-third of the true most-profitable titles.</p>
Note that choosing a title that is âmost likely to be in the top thirdâ is not necessarily the same as âchoosing the title with the greatest expected profit.â Our ranks are a multi-dimensional measure; thus one title need not âdominateâ the other title. E.g., in a sample of <span class="math inline">\(N=100\)</span> title <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> may be ranked first by 10 people and last by 90 people, while title <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> may be ranked second by all 100 people. Which is more profitable on average will depend on the relationship between ranking and probability of attendance.*
<div class="marginnote">
<p>* E.g., perhaps this implies a 90% probability that <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> will be more profitable than <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, but for the 10% of the states-of-the world when is more profitable than <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is 100 times more profitable. This would imply that title <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> has a greater expected value profit, but also involves more risk.</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Nonetheless</strong>,</p>
<p>Consider whether title <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is among the titles that is âranked in the top-thirdâ by the largest share of the population. More specifically, consider <span class="math inline">\(\bar{R}^{7+}_k \equiv E[r_{k}\leq7]\)</span> as the âshare of the population ranking title <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> top 7 out of 20 or better. Let <span class="math inline">\(D_k=1\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{k,j}1\big(\bar{R}^{7+}_k&gt;\bar{R}^{7+}_j\big)\geq7\)</span>; i.e., if <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is one of the top-7 titles in terms of the measure âranked in the top third.â</p>
<p>We might want toâ¦</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>based on our sample (and some assumptions?) choose the title with the highest chance of being ranked in the top-third by the population as a whole (<span class="math inline">\(k^\ast \equiv argmax_k\big(P(D_k=1)\big)\)</span>), and</p></li>
<li><p>sample <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> large enough so that this âchosen titleâ has a <span class="math inline">\(\beta=0.8\)</span> chance of indeed being ranked in the top-third by the population as a whole, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(P(D_{k^\ast}=1)&gt;\beta=0.8\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I imagine that under certain (overly restrictive?) assumptions about the distribution of rankings, we would be able to calculate:</p>

<p>Initial thoughts (unfold):</p>

<div class="fold">
<p>If we assume normality, there should be a simple analytical formula for</p>
<p>âMinimum sample sizeâ¦.
â¦ for (e.g.) 80% likelihood â¦
â¦ of achieving an (e.g.) 95% âconfidence interval (CI) over the meanâ of a variableâ¦
â¦ that is within (e.g.) 1 standard deviation of the variable on either side</p>
<p><em>Notes:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is to get CI bounds on the means stated relative to the SD of the variable. If we wanted to bounds in âunits of the variableâ we would need to know, guess, or estimate the SD of the variable.</p></li>
<li><p>For a Likert variable normality is not a great assumption. We should probably make another assumption over the distribution (or even draw from past data), and then we can either do a similar analytical computation or a simulation based computation (which should be fairly easy)</p></li>
<li><p>I put âCI over the meanâ in scare quotes because these are frequentist confidence intervals which are hard to interpret. A Bayesian approach might be more appropriateâ¦ worth thinking about</p></li>
<li><p>Not sure whether âmean of a Likert-item responseâ is important anyway. Iâll read more on Likert scales.</p></li>

<p>It is lame how often I see ânew experimentsâ and ânew studiesâ that tread most of the ground as old studies, spend lots of money, get a publication and â¦ ignore or pay lip service to the previous findings. There is tons of data out there that can inform new questions and bring better through re-analysis and combination with other data. Otherwise we are not actually building progress. This is why I became involved with a project I called âExpArchive,â later working with projects such as GESISâ X-Econ to try to encourage and facilitate data sharing in experimental economics, as well as the innovationsinfundraising.org project, which is now collaborating with the Lily Instituteâs ârevolutionizing philanthropy researchâ (RPR) project.</p>

<p>âThe random-effects-model pays more attention to small studies when pooling the overall effect in a meta-analysis (Schwarzer, Carpenter, and RÃ¼cker 2015). Yet, small studies in particular are often fraught with bias (see Chapter 8.1). This is why some have argued that the fixed-effects-model should be nearly always preferred (Poole and Greenland 1999; Furukawa, McGuire, and Barbui 2003).â</p>

<h4 class="unnumbered">Setting weakly informativeâ priors for the mean and cross-study variance of the TE sizes</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>It has been argued that a good approach is to use weakly informative priors (Williams, Rast, and BÃ¼rkner 2018) [rather than ânon-informative priors!â].<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a non-informative prior, we are essentially saying that we do not have any prior information on the effect size, whereas often we do have some information, and would like to include it in our analyis. Make sure to research priors before using them, as some be be very informative, with an example being the uniform distibution saying that extreme values are as likely as moderate values.</p>
<p><strong>For</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>include distributions which represent that we do indeed have <strong>some confidence that some values are more credible than others</strong>, while still not making any overly specific statements about the exact true value of the parameter. â¦ In most applied cases, it seems reasonable to assume that the true effect size we want to estimate must lie somewhere between, for example, Cohenâs <span class="math inline">\(d=-2.0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d=2.0\)</span>, but will unlikely be hovering around <span class="math inline">\(d=50\)</span>. A good starting point for our <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> prior may therefore be a normal distribution with mean <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and variance <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. This means that we grant a 95% prior probability that the true pooled effect size <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> lies between <span class="math inline">\(d=-2.0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d=2.0\)</span>.</p>

<p>Discussion (unfold)</p>

<div class="fold">
<p>SD: There has to be very good reason for setting the prior mean to be different from zero, as that would mean holding a prior belief of a (potentially) strong, positive or negative effect. Normally it is better to use a prior with a neutral effect. With regards to the variance of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, consider the order of magnitude of the response, and how much each effect will have. A variance of one is large enough to explore the parameter space, without being too large to allow for extreme values.</p>
<p>â¦ [A prior distinct from 0] only if we genuinely believe there to be a positive effect, otherwise we are not being âconsistentâ (a Bayesian term which links to our probability for an event to being our best guess estimate). Because if we are unsure if there is a positive or negative effect, then we would be âincoherentâ by having a positive prior effect - it would be better for our best guess estimate to have a neutral effect.</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A further discussion on âcoherenceâ in the Bayesian framework versus âbiasâ in the frequentist world (unfold).</p>

<div class="fold">
<p>SD:
I think a big part of the discussion here comes from the subjective-objective debate in probability theory, and the way that statistics is studied. Classical statistics postulates that a variable theta is a true, objective, physical value, and that data y is randomly drawn from a distribution with those parameters. Expectation is defined from probability.</p>
<p>Bayesians on the other hand start with the data; y is not random, it is known to us. The parameters theta are random, in that they are unknown to us (and subjectively unknown to each of us). Probability is defined from expectation, and our probability for an event is our subjective best guess estimate for that event. We are not being coherent if our probability is not our best guess estimate, that is, if we can make a better estimate for sure. If weâre not not coherent, weâre not being consistent with our beliefs.</p>
<p>So because of this, the concept of bias doesnât really exist for subjectivists; there is no long run frequentist true parameter that our best guess is being distant from. Coherence is absolutely key to the concept, as it is about my belief and my best guess. Thatâs where the subjectivity comes into the analysis, because you may believe one prior (for instance one with a mean of 1), whereas I may believe another prior (with a mean of 0). There isnât any correct answer, and as long as we are being coherent, because weâre sampling from our posteriors for this parameter given our own beliefs and our own subjective uncertainty. Often on Bayesian projects there is a prior elicitation, where people come together and discuss what their subjective priors are and how they will proceed.</p>
<p>I think there is some merit in this line of thought though, because clearly if you have a prior with a mean of, say, 1,000,000 then youâre really influencing your effect. But then arguably if you do so, youâre not being coherent. Itâs quite a deep, long, philosophical discussion for a meta analysis, but it is crucial to the frequentist vs Bayesian debate.</p>

<p>DR: I find it surprising how long this procedure takes to run this simulation, given that the actual data used (estimates and SEâs) is rather small. It seems to be that the C++ model takes long to compile; we sort this out below.</p>

<p>The issue here seems to be that it takes a long time to compile the C++ model each time; it might be something we can write to avoid this step.</p>
<p>SD: It will take some time to compile the model, and this is inevitable (it takes a long time with every model, this one works pretty quickly at a few minutes), but once it has compiled, it should not take a long time to sample. Below is some code to change the number of samples and show the speed once the model has compiled.</p>

<p>The number of iterations can be any ââhigh numberââ. A commonly used amount is 2000 iterations and four chains. The reason the number should be high is that the MCMC sampler needs to converge in distribution to the target distribution.</p>
<p>SD: âHighâ may depend on several factors (such as what distribution weâre trying to sample from, the amount of time it takes to sample, how accurate we want it to be, etc.). But broadly we want to make sure we have more samples than fewer as we want to be confident that we have converged to the target distribution. Iâd usually stick to something in the thousands to be sure.</p>

<p>A commonly used method of assessing convergence is to look at the traceplots. There should be no distinctive patterns, and they should not have large spikes. Good traceplots look âwell mixed,â suggesting that the parameter space is being explored.*</p>
<p><em>Is âassessing convergenceâ a subjective judgement?</em> (Unfold a discussion.)</p>

<div class="fold">
<p>SD: We will never know if the sampler has converged to the target distribution, but with more and more samples and well mixed traceplots, along with R-hats close to 1, we can be very confident that it has.</p>
<p>I think that it is the same for other subjective methods such as GAMs, where the number of splines to include is very subjective. There are some tests used to help inform the statistician about the suitability of more/less splines, but ultimately it is down to the statistician to make the judgement about it.</p>
<p>DR: Rather than âsubjectiveâ I would suspect that: 1. There are numerical measures for assessing this convergence (as there are in optimisation problems)
2. Perhaps there remains debate over which is the best method.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>SD: I think that the R hat is one of those numerical methods, Iâm not completely sure about that though. There is a paper discussing them and it comes up on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11827.pdf">Arxiv</a>. I think effective sample size is another one of those numerical measures.</p>
<p>There is some discussion on which methods are best here: <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/507/what-is-the-best-method-for-checking-convergence-in-mcmc" class="uri">https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/507/what-is-the-best-method-for-checking-convergence-in-mcmc</a></p>
<p>It seems that most people use a combination of both numerical methods and visual checking. When I studied it, we checked the Rhat, the effective sample size, and checked for patterns in the trace plots (eg obvious autocorrelation, large spikes, etc)</p>
<p>There are some good slides on visually assessing convergence here: <a href="https://astrostatistics.psu.edu/RLectures/diagnosticsMCMC.pdf" class="uri">https://astrostatistics.psu.edu/RLectures/diagnosticsMCMC.pdf</a></p>

<p>These are measures of <em>deviations</em>. But they donât exactly equal the difference between the input effect size and the estimated pooled effect size.

<p>SD: With a classical analysis, we would ask if there is enough evidence of an effect to reject the null hypothesis of no impact at a (subjective) significance level. With a Bayesian approach, the entire distribution of the parameter is calcuated, is it is better to observe the distribution of the parameter. Frequentist analyses give binary answers to continuous questions, whereas with Bayesian analyses, continuous questions have continuous answers. (Paraphrasing Daniel XXX).</p>

<p>the Estimate of the pooled effect size is SMD = 0.57, with the 95% credibility interval (not confidence interval!) ranging from 95% CrI: 0.40 â 0.77. This indicates that there is in fact a moderate-sized overall effect of the interventions studied in this meta-analysis.</p>

<p>McElreathâs course and text looks great. Iâm taking selective notes here; Iâll try to incorporate content from both text and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WVelCswXo4&amp;list=PLDcUM9US4XdNM4Edgs7weiyIguLSToZRI">youtube video lectures</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://bookdown.org/ajkurz/Statistical_Rethinking_recoded">AJ Kurtz has re-written the code</a> using the <code>brms</code> package, which he finds superior. More crucially for me, he redoes the code using ggplot and tidyverse?</p>
Iâm planning to through this here, adding my own notes, questions, and considerations and (hopefully) incorporating some of my own work.

<p>Donât let your model or approach turn into a Golem you canât control. Donât âbelieve the modelâ; continuously validate it. The map is not the territory.</p>
<p>âStatistical decision treesâ lend a false sense of securityâ¦ and almost never fit the actual case we are dealing with. (fig 1.1)<br />
</p>
<p>Statistical models are non-unique maps to âprocess modelsâ which are non-unique maps to <em>hypotheses</em>. (He offers the example of neutral evolutionary selectionâ example.)</p>
<p>This makes strict falsification impossible: How can you falsify a hypothesis/theory if it corresponds to a wide set of process models and statistical models, many of which overlap other hypotheses?<br />
</p>
<p>But this warning is at least as relevant for Bayesian analyses, which must be based on specifically defined (term) models of the DGP etc. Thus he recommends caution and continuous (?) interplay between the model and the data. (See next chapter â¦ âsmall worlds and large worlds.â)<br />
</p>
<p>He also suggests we refer not to âConfidence intervalsâ or even âCredible intervals,â but to âConsistent intervalsâ â¦ as in âthese intervals are consistent with the model and data.â</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Null hypothesis significance testing, NHST, is often identified with the falsificationist, or Popperian, philosophy of science. However, usually NHST is used to falsify a null hypothesis, not the actual research hypothesis. So the falsification is being done to something other than the explanatory model. This seems the reverse from Karl Popperâs philosophy.</p>

<div class="marginnote">
<p>I.e., scientists have turned things upside down; originally the idea was that you had substitute of hypotheses that you would want to falsify and now we try to falsify silly null hypotheses that ânothing is going on.â You should try to really build a hypothesis and test it not just reject that nothing is going on.</p>

<p>We imagine a bag filled with four marbles, each of which is blue or white.</p>
<p>âSo, if weâre willing to code the marbles as 0 =âwhite" 1 = âblue,â we can arrange the possibility data in a tibble as follows."

<p>Bayes theorem â¦ inverting conditional probability thing â¦ âinversionâ to make inferences about the parameters</p>
<ul>
<li>In Bayesian stats the <em>parameters</em> (and sometimes missing values) are random variables, we make probability statements about them</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(A|B)=P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)\]</span></p>
<p>Frequentist: Point estimates, unknown fixed parameters, data from a hyol repeataable random sample</p>
<p>Bayesian: Fixed data (from the experiment), parameters are random variables â¦ results based on probability distributions about rthese</p>
<p>Classical statistics: likelihood of data given parameter: <span class="math inline">\(p(y|\theta)\)</span></p>
<p>Bayes we want, <span class="math inline">\(p(\theta|y) = p(y|\theta)p(\theta)/p(y)\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(p(y)\)</span> is a âconstantâ in our estimation â¦ the data is fixed.</p>
<p>So itâs proportional to <span class="math inline">\(p(\theta|y) = p(y|\theta)\times p(\theta)\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(p(y|\theta)\)</span> is what we max when we do ML</p>

<p>So we want to find <span class="math inline">\(p(\beta, \sigma^2_\epsilon|Y,X)\)</span>.

<p>Can yield a joint posterior.</p>
<p>Instead, letâs assume that the latter (variance) parameter is known, you can show that the posterior for <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is also normally distributed. (Conjugate)</p>
<p>Similarly, if we assume <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is known, if the variance term had an inverse gamma distribution (prior), so will the posterior.</p>
<p>In these conjugate priors, the posterior mean will be a weighted average of the priors and the data.</p>

<p>This (2013) book seems to have some slightly outdated focus (terms like âdata-miningâ) but it is nonetheless very useful, both conceptually and in many specifics. It does a good job of giving actual insight into mathematical, statistical, and data-science techniques, and uses a reasonable amount of actual maths and some literal code. There is âmeat in this sandwich.â</p>
<p>Terms like âliftâ</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As another example, in evaluating the utility of a pattern, we see a notion of liftâ how much more prevalent a pattern is than would be expected by chanceârecurring broadly across data science. It is used to evaluate very different sorts of patterns in different contexts. Algorithms for targeting advertisements are evaluated by computing the lift one gets for the targeted population. Lift is used to judge the weight of evidence for or against a conclusion. Lift helps determine whether a co-occurrence (an association) in data is interesting, as opposed to simply being a natural consequence of popularity.</p>

<p>Target wanted to get a jump on their competition. They were interested in whether they could predict that people are expecting a baby.

Using techniques of data science, Target analyzed historical data on customers who later were revealed to have been pregnant, and were able to extract information that could predict which consumers were pregnant. For example, pregnant mothers often change their diets, their wardrobes, their vitamin regimens, and so on. These indicators could be extracted from historical data, assembled into predictive models, and then deployed in marketing campaigns.</p>

<p>, but at the time, credit cards essentially had uniform pricing, for two reasons: (1) â¦ [lack of] information systems to deal with differential pricing at massive scale, and (2) bank management believed customers would not stand for price discrimination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A realization: with their data assets,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[they] could do more sophisticated predictive modelingâ¦ and offer different terms (nowadays: pricing, credit limits, low-initial-rate balâ ance transfers, cash back, loyalty points, and so on)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Economic insight: model <em>profitability</em>, not just default probability</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They knew that a small proportion of customers actually account for more than 100% of a bankâs profit from credit card operations (because the rest are break-even or money-losing). If they could model profitability, they could make better offers to the best customers and âskim the creamâ of the big banksâ clientele</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>âFundamental strategy of data science: acquire the necessary data at a costâ</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Different terms were offered at random to different customers. This may seem foolish outside the context of data-analytic thinking: youâre likely to lose money! This is true. In this case, losses are the cost of data acquisition. Losses continued for a few years while the data scientists worked to build predictive models from the data,*</p>

<p>The huge valuation of Facebook has been credited to its vast and unique data assets (Sengupta, 2012), including both information about individuals and their likes, as well as information about the structure of the social network. Information about network structure has been shown to be important to predicting and has been shown to be remarkably helpful in building models of who will buy certain products (Hill, Provost, &amp; Volinsky, 2006).</p>

<p><strong>Why business people need to understand data science</strong></p>
<p>E.g., in making valuations <em>based on data assets</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>venture capitalists must be able to invest wisely in businesses with substantial data assets, and business strategists must be able to devise plans that exploit data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More details and examples (unfold)</p>

<div class="fold">
<blockquote>
<p>As a few examples, if a consultant presents a proposal to mine a data asset to improve your business, you should be able to assess whether the proposal makes sense. If a competitor announces a new data partnership, you should recognize when it may put you at a strategic disadvantage. Or, letâs say you take a position with a venture firm and your first project is to assess the potential for investing in an advertising company. The founders present a convincing argument that they will realize significant value from a unique body of data they will collect, and on that basis are arguing for a substantially higher valuation. Is this reasonable? With an understanding of the fundamentals of data science you should be able to devise a few probing questions to determine whether their valuation arguments are plausible.</p>

<p>One very general and important concern during data preparation is to beware of âleaksâ (Kaufman et al.Â 2012).

As an example, when predicting whether at a particular point in time a website visitor would end her session or continue surfing to another page, the variable âtotal number of webpages visited in the sessionâ is predictive. However, the total number of webpages visited in the session would not be known until after the session was over (Kohavi et al., 2000)âat which point one would know the value for the target variable! As another illustrative example, consider predicting whether a customer will be a âbig spenderâ; knowing the categories of the items purchased (or worse, the amount of tax paid) are very predictive, but are not known at decision-making time (Kohavi &amp; Parekh, 2003).</p>

<p>because if we take away the axis-parallel boundaries (see Figure 4-2) we can see that there clearly are other, possibly better, ways to partition</p>

<p>example, we can separate the instances almost perfectly (by class) if we are allowed to introduce a boundary that is still a straight line, but is not perpendicular to the axes (</p>
<p>dataset of Figure 4-2 with a single linear split. This is called a linear classifier and is essentially a weighted sum of the values for the various attributes, as we will describe next.</p>
<p>Linear Discriminant Functions</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Equation 4-1. Classification function class(-) = { + if 1.0 - Age - 1.5 Ã Balance + 60 &gt; 0 - if 1.0 Ã Age - 1.5 Ã Balance + 60 â¤ 0 This is called a linear discriminant because it discriminates between the classes, and the function of the decision boundary is a linear combination-a weighted sumâof the attributes</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f(\cdot) = 60 + 1.0 \times Age - 1.5 \times Balance\)</span></p>
<p>To use this model as a linear discriminant, for a given instance represented by a feature vector x, we check whether f(x) is positive or negative. As discussed above, in the twodimensional case, this corresponds to seeing whether the instance x falls above or below the line</p>
<p>We now have a parameterized model: the weights of the linear function (<span class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span>) are the parameters.</p>
<p>Roughly, the larger the magnitude of a featureâs weight, the more important that feature is for classifying the target with standardization</p>

<p>for Scoring and Ranking InstancesIn other applications, we do not need a precise probability estimate. We simply need a score that will rank cases by the likelihood of belonging to one class or the other. For example, for targeted marketing we may have a limited budget for targeting prospective customers. We would like to have a list of consumers ranked by their predicted likeli- hood of responding positively to our offer</p>
<p>for Scoring and Ranking InstancesThus f(x) itselfâthe output of the linear discriminant functionâgives an intuitively satisfying ranking of the instances by their (estimated) likelihood of belong- ing to the class of interest.</p>
<p>Support Vector Machines, Briefly</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In short, support vector machines are linear discriminants</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>SVMs choose based on a simple, elegant idea: instead of thinking about separating with a line, first fit the fattest bar between the classes</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Then once the widest bar is found, the linear discriminant will be the center line through the bar</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>distance between the dashed parallel lines is called the margin around the linear discriminant, and thus the objective is to maximize the margin.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hopefully they will be distributed similarly to the training data, but they will in fact be different points. In particular, some of the positive examples will likely fall closer to the discriminant boundary than any positive example we have yet seen. All else being equal, the same applies to the negative examples. In other words, they may fall in the margin. The margin-maximizing boundary gives the maximal lee- way for classifying such points</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>original example of Figure 4-2 shows a situaâ tion in which a single line cannot perfectly separate the data into classes. This is true of most data from complex real-world applications</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the case where the data indeed are linearly separable, we incur no penalty and simply maximize the margin. If the data are not linearly separable, the best fit is some balance between a fat margin and a low total error penalty. The penalty for a misclassified point is proportional to the distance from the decision boundary, so if possible the SVM will make only -small" errors</p>

<p>Errors have positive distances from the separator in Figure 4-9, while correct classifications have negative distances</p>

<p>The hinge loss only becomes positive when an example is on the wrong side of the boundary and beyond the margin. Loss then increases linearly with the example-s distance from the margin, thereby penalizing points more the farther they are from the separating boundary.

<p>Though classification trees and linear classifiers both use linear decision boundaries, there are two important differences between them: 1. A classification tree uses decision boundaries that are perpendicular to the instancespace axes (see Figure 4-1), whereas the linear classifier can use decision boundaries of any direction or orientation (see Figure 4-3). This is a direct consequence of the fact that classification trees select a single attribute at a time whereas linear classifiers use a weighted combination of all attributes</p>

<p>Support vector machines have a so-called âkernel functionâ that maps the original features to some other feature space. Then a linear model is fit to this new feature space, just as</p>
<p>implement a nonlinear support vector machine with a âpolynomial kerâ nel,- which essentially means it would considerâhigher-order" combinations</p>
<p>One can think of a neural network as a -stack" of models. On the bottom of the stack are the original features. From these features are learned a variety of relatively simple models. Let-s say these are logistic regressions. Then, each subsequent layer in the stack applies a simple model (let-s say, another logistic regression) to the outputs of the next layer down</p>
<p>We could think of this very roughly as first creating a set of -experts" in different facets of the problem (the first-layer models), and then learning how to weight the opinions of these different experts (the second-layer model).</p>
<p>more generally with neural networks target labels for training are provided only for the final layer (the actual target variable).</p>
<p>The stack of models can be represented by one big parameterized numeric function. The so why consider it in many layers?</p>
<p>we can then apply an optimization procedure to find the best parameters to this very complex numeric function</p>
<p>When weâre done, we have the parameters to all the models, and thereby have learned the -best" set of lower-level experts and also the best way to comâ bine them, all simultaneously "</p>
<p><strong>OF:</strong> Neural Networks are made up of layers of <em>perceptrons.</em> These models are given an input vector and assign weights to each input. The inputs are combined into a weighted sum which is passed through an âactivation functionâ that decides on the outcome classification. This method is known as âforward propagation.â A useful analogy from (Melania, 2019):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, you might get input from several friends on how much they liked a particular movie, but you trust some of those friendsâ taste in movies more than others. If the total amount of âfriend enthusiasmââgiving more weight to your more trusted friendsâis high enough (that is, greater than some unconscious threshold), you decide to go to the movie. This is how a perceptron would decide about movies, if only it had friends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
It is the way in which these weights are learned that is both mentally and computationally strenuous. The âback-propagationâ algorithm is key to the way that weights are learned. The procedure involves multiple stages. Essentially we initialize our model with a random state, feed our input data in and compute the error that our model has made. Then our model works backwards and updates the weights in a manner which provides a prediction consistent with the true data. This updating process can and often is done multiple times.</p>

OF: <strong>What is clustering and why is it useful?</strong> Clustering analysis is a form of unsupervised learning which focuses around splitting data into groups. The aim of this is to identify key patterns in our data. For example: The supermarket Tesco may wish to identify which products are bought together by consumers. Using clustering may reveal that 80% customers who buy bread also buy milk. Insights such as these could be used in order to alter the layout of a supermarket in order to encourage higher spending.<br />
Whilst insights such as the one given in the example above are very simple, in larger datasets it can be much more difficult to draw insights such as these. Provided that the correct method is used, clustering is an incredibly powerful tool for exploring big datasets.<br />
Clustering uses distance measures in order to group similar observations into clusters.</p>
<p><strong>K-Means</strong>:
- Simple and easy to implement
- Efficient
- Difficult to know the value of K to specify
- Sensitive to the initial points chosen</p>
<p><strong>DBSCAN</strong>
- Very good at dealing with noise
- Can handle different shaped clusters
- Tends to perform worse when the density of data varies or when data is highly dimensional</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered">Meta-analysis arbitrary example: the âPaleo dietâ</h1>
<p>Introduction and discussion</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Summarize the evidence base for the effectiveness of the Paleo diet in reducing obesity (as measured by waist circumference). Please cover: a) the basics of the intervention being studied; b) the research methodology; c) the results.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is your conclusion on how effective the Paleo diet is at reducing waist circumference? What do you regard as the key strengths and limitations of the evidence and why?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Briefly, what are the major uncertainties in your analysis? How could your conclusion be wrong? This will likely involve saying what you explicitly chose not to do and what you do not know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is some evidence supporting the claim that the âPaleo dietâ reduces obesity as measured by waist circumference, at least for certain targeted groups relative to certain âstandard recommended diets. At least a small set of randomized trials have concluded that participants in the âPaleo diet treatmentâ groups reduced their waist circumference more than those in control groups.</p>
<p>This evidence is summarized in the meta-analysis of <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-manheimerPaleolithicNutritionMetabolic2015" role="doc-biblioref">Manheimer et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-manheimerPaleolithicNutritionMetabolic2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> who report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Paleolithic diet resulted in greater short-term improvements in metabolic syndrome components than did guideline-based control diets. The available data warrant additional evaluations of the health benefits of Paleolithic nutrition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More recent meta-analyses in reputable journals have also found favorable results (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-ghaediEffectsPaleolithicDiet2019" role="doc-biblioref">Ghaedi et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-ghaediEffectsPaleolithicDiet2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-demenezesInfluencePaleolithicDiet2019a" role="doc-biblioref">de Menezes et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-demenezesInfluencePaleolithicDiet2019a" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>).</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>According to <a href="https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php?category=2916">Scimago</a>, American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-manheimerPaleolithicNutritionMetabolic2015" role="doc-biblioref">Manheimer et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-manheimerPaleolithicNutritionMetabolic2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>) ranked second among Nutrition and Dietetics journals, Advances in Nutrition (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-ghaediEffectsPaleolithicDiet2019" role="doc-biblioref">Ghaedi et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-ghaediEffectsPaleolithicDiet2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>) is ranked fourth, and Nutrition Journal (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-demenezesInfluencePaleolithicDiet2019a" role="doc-biblioref">de Menezes et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-demenezesInfluencePaleolithicDiet2019a" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>) is ranked 35th.</p>
</div>
<p>However, the Paleo diet remains controversial; it is still referred to as a âfad dietâ on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet">Wikipedia</a> (accessed 20 Dec 2020), which claims âthere is no good evidence that following a paleolithic diet lessens the risk of cardiovascular disease or metabolic syndrome.â*</p>

Randomized controlled trials on nutrition and diet have important limitations not faced by many other medical RCTs, such as drug trials.
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Another important limitation: âRCTs of dietary interventions
cannot be controlled with true placebos, but rather with certain constraints on nutrient compositions, food groups, or dietary patternsâ <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-schwingshacklPerspectiveNutriGradeScoring2016" role="doc-biblioref">Schwingshackl et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-schwingshacklPerspectiveNutriGradeScoring2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>. They also cite
âlack of double blindingâ¦ crossover bias, and high dropout ratesâ; although dropout (attrition) is not an exclusive problem for dietary studies.</p>
</div>
<p><em>Limited compliance</em> is a particularly important issue: not all participants who are assigned to a particular diet will carefully follow this diet. There are ways of <em>tracking</em> compliance (e.g.Â âDiet-associated biomarkersâ such as 24-hour urine checks, which are highly-rated by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-schwingshacklPerspectiveNutriGradeScoring2016" role="doc-biblioref">Schwingshackl et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-schwingshacklPerspectiveNutriGradeScoring2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>âs Nutrigrade). There are also ways of encouraging and incentivizing compliance, such as providing free food (as in <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-boersFavourableEffectsConsuming2014" role="doc-biblioref">Boers et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-boersFavourableEffectsConsuming2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>However, our consideration of this issue depends on what exactly itis we want to measure, and for what purpose. For example may want to consider either, what I will callâ¦ *</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>* Note that my terminology below comes from the âtreatment effectâ literature in statistics and econometrics, with some slight abuses of terminology. See, e.g., <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-angristIdentificationEstimationLocal1995" role="doc-biblioref">Joshua D. Angrist and Imbens</a> (<a href="#ref-angristIdentificationEstimationLocal1995" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span>.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>âAverage Treatment Effect (ATE)â: The difference in some medical outcome, averaged over the population of interestâ¦ for the âTreatment dietâ if consumed exactly as proposed relative to a âControl diet.â**</li>
</ol>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>** Even here, there may be some ambiguities that need to be clarified. Should these diets specify exact amounts/calories consumed (âisocaloricâ), or only the types of foods, allowingconsumption as desired? Do we need to ensure that other patterns, such as exercise, are held constant across diets? (One might imagine that with random treatment exercise patterns will be identical on average, however, some diet may give people more energy to do exercise. We need to decide whether this is part of the effect we wish to consider.)</p>
</div>
<p><em>or the</em></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>âIntention to Treat (ITT)â effect: The difference in some medical outcome, averaged over the population of interestâ¦ for those <em>assigned</em> to the treatment diet relative to the control diet.</li>
</ol>
<p>The ATE measure would seem to be more relevant:</p>
<ul>
<li>if we want to get at basic biological mechanisms or</li>
<li>if we believe we should recommed a âbest dietâ without adjusting for compliance. *
<div class="marginnote">
<p>E.g., perhaps we are making recommendations for a context where compliance is not particularly difficult (e.g.Â perhaps school or military meals). It may also be reasonable to assume that people reading our analysis (e.g., dieters), will already make these self-control considerations themselves, and simply wish to know which diet would ve best, if they could live up to it.</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand the ITT measure might be more relevant if we want to consider which diet to propose âfor real people to achieve their best outcomes.â However:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>while the impact of the diet itself (the ATE) might be expected to be fairly uniform, as the basic biological mechanisms will be similar for similar groups of people,</p></li>
<li><p>I would expect that the ITT measure to have more heterogeneity and variation, as compliance with a particular diet might be expected to vary greatly for a variety of psychological and cultural/lifestyle reasons.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus the ITT may be more sensitive to the representativeness of our sample of dieters. Given self selection and other issues, it may be extremely difficult to recruit a ânationally representativeâ sample of the targeted group.</p>
<p>In the discussion of <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-manheimerPaleolithicNutritionMetabolic2015" role="doc-biblioref">Manheimer et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-manheimerPaleolithicNutritionMetabolic2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>, it is not clear to me which measure of the studies are targeting. The discussion (âwhether Paleolithic <em>nutrition</em> has any effect in improving metabolic risk factors,â emphasis added) seems to suggest that they are considering the ATE. However most of the designs seem to involve simply different <em>recommendations</em> for treatment and control groups; these would seem much more likely to pick up the ITT for their study sample.</p>

</div>
<p>In the individual studies, the Paleo diet participants reduced their waist circumference (âWCâ) by an average of 3-11cm, with some differences across studies. For control diet participants the reduction was between 3 and 6 cm on average. The âdifference in lossâ ranged from</p>
<ul>
<li>a virtual zero with a 95% confidence interval of [-4cm, +4cm] in Boers et al (the study where food was provided)</li>
<li>to a 5.5 cm greater loss for Paleo diets (in Mellberg et al).</li>
</ul>
<p>The reported meta-analytic estimate is an average of 2.38 cm greater loss in Paleo relative to the control diet, with a 95% confidence interval [-4.73, -0.04], thus a âjust significantâ difference at the standard NHST threshold of <span class="math inline">\(p&lt;0.05\)</span>.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>Does this imply a large relative effect of Paleo?</em> <em>Does it bound the effect as âsmall at bestâ</em>?</p>
To consider the magnitude of an effect such as this, it is helpful to consider overall averages and spreads.
The average US male WC is roughly 102 cm (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-fryarMeanBodyWeight2018" role="doc-biblioref">Fryar et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-fryarMeanBodyWeight2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>) and 98 cm for womenâ¦*
<div class="marginnote">
<p>* I could not quickly find a reputable source for averages in Sweden and Netherlands, where most of the studies were conducted, but <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2441250/Average-BMI-Artist-compares-sizes-men-various-countries.html">secondhand reports</a> suggest it is somewhat smaller, perhaps 90 cm.</p>
</div>
â¦ which (for men) is also approximately the <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/metabolic-syndrome/about-metabolic-syndrome">threshold circumference considered a risk factor for metabolic syndrome</a> (accessed 29 Dec 2020). I quickly, (and perhaps incorrectly) imputed a standard-deviation of roughly 52 cm.**
<div class="marginnote">
<p>** Drawing from <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-fryarMeanBodyWeight2018" role="doc-biblioref">Fryar et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-fryarMeanBodyWeight2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> statistics, I multiplied the square root of the reported sample size (<span class="math inline">\(\sqrt(43169 )\)</span>) by the reported standard error of 0.1 (for the table in inches, the figure in the centimeter table didnât make sense), and converted back to cm. This calculation may be incorrect; I would like to check it, or better still, find some scientific estimates of dispersion measures for this (SD, quantile, IQR, etc.) I would also like to read more about what WC losses are considered normal, reasonable, and substantial in this context.</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Heterogeneity</strong></p>
The evidence also suggest between-study heterogeneity; at least we do not have strong evidence that would allow us to rule this out. Prima facie, we see strong differences between the studies. In particular, the one study with a strongly different methodology (Boers et al), finds a much smaller (near-zero effect). In their formal measures, we see an <span class="math inline">\(I^2\)</span> of 52%, conventionally classified as âmoderate heterogeneity.â I believe <span class="math inline">\(\tau^2 of 2.81\)</span> can be interpreted as a âstandard deviation in true effect size between studiesâ of <span class="math inline">\(\tau =\)</span> 1.68, which seems, again, âmoderate.â***
<div class="marginnote">
<p>*** I suspect that if we allowed a variety of other methods of estimating and reporting this (including Bayesian) and we reported the confidence/credible intervals on this between-study variance, the results might suggest the possibility of more substantial heterogeneity.</p>
</div>
Although the NHST for heterogeneity is not significant by standard measures (<span class="math inline">\(P=0.10\)</span>), a simple âfailure to reject in a diagnostic testâ does not constitute substantial reason to ignore a potentially-important concern.*
<div class="marginnote">
<p>A âfailure to reject the nullâ is not in itself, strong evidence for the null hypothesis. Among other things, I suspect a lack of power to detect heterogeneity with only four studies.</p>

This study is also particular strong because it has (apparently) a zero attrition rate (â34/34 analyzedâ), while attrition in the other cited studies is substantial. Particular forms of non-random attrition can strongly bias estimated treatment effects, biasing both the ATE and ITT mentioned above.*

<p>My overall impression from the above is that the meta-analytic results do suggest some benefit of the Paleo diet in reducing waist circumference for groups that are vulnerable to the metabolic syndrome.</p>
<p>However:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The evidence plausibly suggests that the benefit of this diet comes largely through greater adherence, rather than through a direct nutritional advantage. Perhaps, as is popular conventional wisdom âeating more proteinssimply makes it easier to feel full and thus not overeat.â</p></li>
<li><p>The studies I have seen compare the diet only to a traditional diet, rather than to another low carbohydrate diet. Thus, I do not see any strong evidence that the Paleo diet offers advantages (or disadvantages) over, e.g., the âSouth Beachâ or âKetoâ diets. Thus the evidence does not support (nor refute) the <em>mechanism and diet philopsophy</em> behind Paleo.<br />
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, there also appears to be <strong>limited evidence</strong>; I am not highly confident in even the above claim. I did not see aa wide array of high-quality studies evaluating the Paleo diet for the relevant large and diverse populations in natural settings.</p>

<p><strong>Caveats:</strong> I am an economist, not a nutritionist or a life scientist. While I am working to build up my expertise in this area I have only limited experience conducting and for evaluating meta-analyses. The evaluation here was only a limited and shallow exercise done in a 10 hour window for a specific purpose. I did not do a broad and systematic review of the literature.</p>
<p>I was only able to take a narrow focus for this exercise, mainly considering <a href="mailto:only@manheimerPaleolithicNutritionMetabolic2015" class="email">only@manheimerPaleolithicNutritionMetabolic2015</a> review, as well as some connected work. To gain a more reliable answer to this question, there are a number of further , involving gaining better understanding, digging deeper into the data and analysis, and consulting a range of experts.</p>

<p><strong>Some steps I would take</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Better understand: <em>What is the relevant question?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>As I suggested above, the nature of evidence that is appropriate will depend on what question is being asked, and what purpose this is being put to. Why do we care about the answer to this? Are we considering recommending this diet to a particular population? How strong incentive/food provision will we be able to provide? Are we deeply interested in the biological mechanisms or the behavioral ones? What do we intend to do with the results of this analysis, i.e., what policy choices will it inform?</p>
<p>If I had better answers to question like these, I would know which types of studies to focus on, and how to better consider their results.</p>

<p>A letter to my co-authorsâ¦</p>
<p>Hi all.</p>
<p>Hope you are doing well. Iâve just invited you to a shared Zotero group managing my bibliography/references. I think this should be useful. (I prefer Zotero to Mendeley because itâs open source andâ¦ I forgot the other reason.)
On my computer it synchronizes with a .bib (bibtex) file in a dropbox folder â¦</p>
<p>For latex files we just refer to this as normal.
In the Rmd files/bookdown (producing output like <a href="#https://daaronr.github.io/ea_giving_barriers/outline.html">EA barriers</a> or Metrics notes (present book) this is referenced in the YAML header to the index.Rmd file as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>bibliography: [reinstein_bibtex.bib]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, to keep this file, I have a âdownload blockâ included in that same file (the first line with âdropboxâ is the key one).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are new to tidyverse-style syntax, possibly the oddest component is the pipe (i.e., <code>%&gt;%</code>). Iâm not going to explain the <code>%&gt;%</code> in this project, but you might learn more about in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yjhxvu-pDg">this brief clip</a>, starting around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-ss_ag2k9E&amp;t=1285s">minute 21:25 in this talk by Wickham</a>, or in <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#combining-multiple-operations-with-the-pipe">section 5.6.1 from Grolemund and Wickhamâs <em>R for Data Science</em></a>. Really, all of Chapter 5 of <em>R4DS</em> is just great for new R and new tidyverse users. And <em>R4DS</em> Chapter 3 is a nice introduction to plotting with ggplot2.</p>

<p>Use <code>lower_snake_case</code> to name <em>all</em> objects (thatâs my preference anyways) unless thereâs a strong reason to do otherwise.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This includes:</p>
<p><code>file_names.txt</code> <code>folder_names</code> <code>function_names</code> (with few exceptions) <code>names_of_data_objects_like_vectors</code> <code>names_of_data_output_objects_like_correlation_coefficients</code> <code>ex_df1</code> In R you probably should keep data frame names short to avoid excessive typing</p>
<p><br />

<p><em>And by all that is holy, never put spaces or slashes in file or object names!</em> This can make it very hard to process across systemsâ¦ there are various ways of referring to spaces and other white space.</p>

<h3 number="20.5.6"><span class="header-section-number">20.5.6</span> Coding style and indenting in Stata (one approach)</h3>
<p>I indent every line except</p>
<ul>
<li><p>clear, import, save, merge (âfile operationsâ)</p>
<ul>
<li>except where these occur as part of a loop, in which case I put in an âimportant commentâ noting these operations</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>lines that call other do files</p></li>
<li><p>important comments/flags/to-doâs</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I only put âsmall todoâ elements having to do with code in a code file itself (and even then there may be better places). If we are going to put todos I suggest we include <code>#todo</code> to search for these later (and R has a utility to collect these in a nice wayâ¦ maybe Stata does too.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Whenever there are more than 20 lines of something prosaic that cannot/has not been put into a loop or function, I suggest we put it in a separate âdoâ file and call that do file (with no indent). Thatâs what I do here, giving a brief description and a âback link.â Sometimes I put all those do files into an separate folder.</p>

<p>Extract out the common code with a function and repeat using a map function from <code>purrr</code>. This problem is structured a little differently to what youâve seen before. Instead of repeating an action for each variable, we want to repeat an action for each country, a subset of rows. To do that, we need a new data structure: the nested data frame. To create a nested data frame we start with a grouped data frame, and ânestâ it:</p>

Then we unnest this column.

<p>List-columns are often most useful as intermediate data structure. [to keep things organised before later unnesting or whatever]</p>
<p>Generally there are three parts of an effective list-column pipeline:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You create the list-column using one of <code>nest()</code>, <code>summarise()</code> + <code>list()</code>, or <code>mutate()</code> + a map function, as described in <a href="#creating-list-columns">Creating list-columns</a>.</li>
<li>You create other intermediate list-columns by transforming existing list columns with <code>map()</code>, <code>map2()</code> or <code>pmap()</code>. For example, in the case study above, we created a list-column of models by transforming a list-column of data frames.</li>
<li>You simplify the list-column back down to a data frame or atomic vector, as described in <a href="#simplifying-list-columns">Simplifying list-columns</a>.</li>

<p>Data frames with list-columns provide a solution to a common problem: what do you do if you want to iterate over both the contents of a list and its elements? Instead of trying to jam everything into one object, itâs often easier to make a data frame: one column can contain the elements, and one column can contain the list. An easy way to create such a data frame from a list is <code>tibble::enframe()</code>.</p>

<p>The advantage of this structure is that it generalises in a straightforward way - names are useful if you have character vector of metadata, but donât help if you have other types of data, or multiple vectors.</p>
<p>Now if you want to iterate over names and values in parallel, you can use <code>map2()</code>:</p>

<h5 number="20.6.1.0.1"><span class="header-section-number">20.6.1.0.1</span> Simplifying list-columns</h5>
<p>To apply the techniques of data manipulation and visualisation youâve learned in this book, youâll need to simplify the list-column back to a regular column (an atomic vector), or set of columns. The technique youâll use to collapse back down to a simpler structure depends on whether you want a single value per element, or multiple values:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If you want a single value, use <code>mutate()</code> with <code>map_lgl()</code>, <code>map_int()</code>, <code>map_dbl()</code>, and <code>map_chr()</code> to create an atomic vector.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want many values, use <code>unnest()</code> to convert list-columns back to regular columns, repeating the rows as many times as necessary.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These are described in more detail below.</p>

<h3 number="20.6.2"><span class="header-section-number">20.6.2</span> List to vector</h3>
<p>If you can reduce your list column to an atomic vector then it will be a regular column. For example, you can always summarise an object with its type and length, so this code will work regardless of what sort of list-column you have:</p>

<p>This is the same basic information that you get from the default tbl print method, but now you can use it for filtering. This is a useful technique if you have a heterogeneous list, and want to filter out the parts arenât working for you.</p>
<p>Donât forget about the <code>map_*()</code> shortcuts - you can use <code>map_chr(x, "apple")</code> to extract the string stored in <code>apple</code> for each element of <code>x</code>. This is useful for pulling apart nested lists into regular columns. Use the <code>.null</code> argument to provide a value to use if the element is missing (instead of returning <code>NULL</code>):</p>

<p>The broom package provides three general tools for turning models into tidy data frames:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><code>broom::glance(model)</code> returns a row for each model. Each column gives a model summary: either a measure of model quality, or complexity, or a combination of the two.</p></li>
<li><p><code>broom::tidy(model)</code> returns a row for each coefficient in the model. Each column gives information about the estimate or its variability.</p></li>
<li><p><code>broom::augment(model, data)</code> returns a row for each row in <code>data</code>, adding extra values like residuals, and influence statistics.</p></li>
